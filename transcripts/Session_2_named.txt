Bazlo: Alright, so getting back into this. Last time y'all slayed the werewolf or uncursed the werewolf. The didn'ts fog still was swirling around you. Question to you all. Have we made our way into the ruins for the evening? Are we still huddled around the werewolf? What do we want to do?
Bazlo: I thought we were going to the ruins to make camp for the night. Because we did get the long rest, yeah. Awesome. So with that, right, we're going to say you guys just started your long rest. The mist has gone and enveloped this whole building. You can't see outside of it. All you have is the glow of your campfire, the one-armed man laying in the corner, unconscious.
Albert: So, yeah, let's open it up there. So we're not going to bed yet. We're just chilling right now. Yep, chilling right now. Baypiff, I need to speak with you. Yes? Well, it seems that we had the werewolf that would have secured our job. And now this...
Albert: religious fucking guy has uh turned him into a not werewolf in addition to using one of our decursed potions or scrolls of decurs so is he working against us or is he just dumb
Bapef: Well, he's a victim of a most un... He's a victim of a very bad circumstance, you know? At least we helped the guy, you know? I don't know if we helped the guy. Maybe he liked being a werewolf. I highly doubt that. That comes with a lot of stuff.
Bapef: Maybe he liked that stuff, but nonetheless, he has used our resources against us to make us fail our quest. Yes, but, you know, in hindsight, you could feel good about the fact that you cured him of his condition. No, I take no solace in that. I'll speak to you rather more plainly.
Bapef: Why wouldn't you want to save somebody? We weren't sent out here to save someone. We were sent out here to gather werewolf. It's kind of in the nature of the job. As it stands, no one else can hear this. I'll meet you halfway. How about I set a snare for tonight's camp?
Bapef: You're going to try to catch another werewolf? Oh, yes. If you say go, we go. Very well. Bapef rummages around in his backpack, now that we're in a secured area, pulls out about his 50-foot section of rope, cuts it in half, and creates a snare just on the edge of camp.
Bazlo: So, are you going to wander out into the mist to set that snare? Just on the edge of camp, but yes. Barely, but... I'm gonna go with them. Yeah. Okay. I want you both to give me... How far are you going out into this mist?
Bapef: far enough for somebody that was sneaking up to be able to try to listen in so what's the distance for like a five ten foot range probably right yeah what's the distance for listening in i don't know that exactly mike we'll say 15 feet
Bazlo: 15 feet. So you both venture out into the mist, and as you do, your chests begin to feel heavy. It feels like the weight of the world is both pressed upon you. You make it 15 feet, you ensnare the trap, and you both gain a point of exhaustion. Time to turn around. Yeah, it's gnarly out here, dude.
Bapef: Perhaps we should tell the others. This is exhausting. I genuinely feel even more tired than I was before. We can begin to trudge back to the house. Anybody else? I share this information with the others. It's exhausting to be in that fog.
Theron: Do you happen to have any spells that could lighten the fog? Me? No. I don't think so. I guess we should stay out of it then. Perfect. Who's going to set watch? Who's going to be the first watch? I'll be the first watch.
Bazlo: So as everybody, you know, begins to bed down for the night, you know, you stand watch out into the mist and you can't see anything beyond essentially a few inches in front of your face. It just becomes thicker and thicker and the fire begins to crackle. And I need you to make a wisdom saving throw, Danny. Okay. Saving throw is right here.
Bazlo: That's not good. No, it is not. So as you begin to stare deeper and deeper into this mist, it becomes hypnotic. You feel your eyes begin to get drowsy, and then you drift away into a deep, deep sleep.
Bazlo: So as everybody is asleep in the camp here, all of you begin to have a dream. You hear wolves howling in the background. You hear screams. You hear the world around you just come closer and closer. As you all awake, it has become light outside. The mist is still there, but there seems to be a little bit out in front of you that you can see a little bit deeper into.
Bazlo: As you also wake up, you notice that your compatriot is no longer there. There seems to be a trail of blood out into the fog. Did we receive a full rest or no? Yes, you all get a full rest. As I wake up, I gasp and go, White Wolf! White Wolf! I don't know if anybody hears that at what stage I wake up, but... Everybody wakes up at the same time, so...
Albert: I lean over to my compatriot. White wolf, what are you referring to? I had a very similar dream. It was another, I don't know if it was a vision or just a dream. I saw a monstrous white werewolf and for whatever reason I wasn't able to cast magic in my dream. I don't know what it means. This is troubling.
Bapef: I believe this area we are in right now is not safe. Speaking of which, Baypuff looks around. Where is our other friend? Oh, we're missing someone, boys. Who are we missing? Are we missing Danny, or are we missing the guy we saved? You are missing the guy that you quote-unquote saved. Oh, dear.
Bazlo: That's not good. I'd like to investigate to see if there's any blood trails or anything. Yeah, give me an investigation check. All you see is drag marks and blood. There might be other prints, but you just can't discern them.
Bazlo: Can I check the blood and see if it's human? Yeah, absolutely. Give me a medicine check. Ten. Ten. You can absolutely tell that this is human blood. Well, we tried. Time to go home. We still haven't completed our mission. We have no werewolf to turn in. We had something, now we have nothing. Boys, I believe we can follow...
Theron: these blood trails, he probably went back to where there are more werewolves. If we follow this, we may find another. Well, uh, Ms. Fogg... What the fog?
Bazlo: Is it daytime yet? How's the fog looking? It's lightened up a little bit. You definitely see a path in front of you where the blood trail has gone out, but you can't see too much further than 15 feet in front of you. And it is daytime. Where in relation to my snare are the drag trails? We will say they are just off and to the left of the drag trails. Perhaps we should go check my trap.
Bazlo: That would be a good idea. Bay Path, give me a perception check. 11. Yeah, nothing out of the ordinary for you. Can you start the session even with the title screen so we can see rolls? I thought I could start the session. He did, just hit refresh. I'm just seeing the ruins image.
Bazlo: but not the map. Yep. That's right. Yep. Yep. And chat GPT is fucking awesome for their shit, by the way. Did you design that image? I just did. I've been using chat GPT for like Dolly for all of like the, the things. So yeah. Super nice. That's awesome. Pretty sweet. Um, so what do we want to do guys? Do we want to,
UnknownSP7: Go look for our buddy. Just to clarify, my trap is unsprung, right? Your trap's no longer there. Is the one-armed man still with us? No, he's the guy that presumably got drug away. Well, gentlemen, we have two options. We follow the trail or we head back. We still need a wolf to burn back.
DM: Alright, I say I vote for following the trail. I vote that as well. That is my vote as well. Jesus, friend. Well, it's not mine, but we're all here together, so I'm not walking off on my own. And what would your solution be? Yeah, just, uh, what are your thoughts? Why? Why?
Elzerios: Well, we struggled hard enough the first time fighting werewolves. There will probably be more where they're taking them. Right. I rather like living. So you don't feel confident you can take out a werewolf again? He brings up a good point. He does. Perhaps he got reclaimed. And perhaps we would find more werewolves following him.
Bazlo: yeah a good song i meant i'm into it so everybody's uh ready to follow the trail then this is outside of miles so yeah uh beginning of the day question do we remove a ration do we remove what yes remove a ration um
Bazlo: Yeah, everybody remove a ration. Water-wise, I don't feel like having you guys go hunt for fucking water. So a water skin will last you four days. How about that? Cool. Hey, completely unrelated. Does anyone else have the upcoming event D&D banner that doesn't go away? Nope. I haven't seen it. I made it go away. I think there was just an X on it that comes up over your map. Are you...
Bazlo: Oh, it finally went away for no reason whatsoever. All right. I started the event. That's probably why. As we walk out the door, you see me just wave my hand, and I go shimmery for a second, and then drop. I have mage armor on. Perfect. So as you all continue into the woods, give me a group perception check.
Bazlo: I can't see shit out here, boys. You all begin to notice that the trees aren't the same as when you were coming into the ruins. It seems like you all are in a completely different place in the woods.
Elzerios: Baypath takes a look around and is like, things here are different from the area that we once came from. This is a bad omen, I believe. Can I reach out and touch one of the trees? Sure, absolutely. Give me a nature check.
Bazlo: And which tree are you going to go after here? Let's say you're walking down the path. The trees are probably 10 to 15 feet off of the actual path. The closest one, but trying to stay in range of my compatriots. Cool. And what do you want to know about this tree? I want to look, just take a feel on this tree and look at its condition. Is it sickly?
Bazlo: Main concern. I wouldn't say it's sickly. It's definitely not the same trees of the forest that you entered into with them. Okay. Different species or just different traits? Different species. Okay.
Bazlo: As you guys continue down the path, the fog starts to get thicker and thicker. As you all start to huddle, or not huddle, but form into a straight line, the person at the back can't necessarily see the person at the front. You can't see anything around you past three feet. How's the trail looking? The trail's still normal. You can tell where the trail is at.
Bazlo: And I use. Give me an investigation check to you. You look down and notice that the blood is no longer there on the trail. Gentlemen, let's pause for a second. I there is no blood anymore. Where are we going?
UnknownSP8: I don't know who did we have tracking the blood. Can I use my senses to smell the air? Yeah, absolutely. Give me a perception check. Baypef reaches down and taps the ground and tries to smell for the same odor that we were originally following. Hmm.
Elzerios: You can't make out the scent. There's too many other smells of leaves and decay. We do have a trail, gentlemen, but it believes our target is... I'm unable to confirm if he is here or not, or continuing to be going on this trail. Can we backtrack to where we see blood again, and then just follow the blood?
Bazlo: Yeah, are we leaving footprints? Give me a group perception check. I'm not the one today. Alright, don't worry, your friend's made up for it, essentially. So you can see the marks that you've made on the trail, yes.
Elzerios: Perhaps that's the best course for now, is perhaps follow them back. Did we hit blood again? Who was tracking this blood? How did we get off the track? In my experience, the loss of a trail of blood usually comes from one of two things. The creature died and its heart stopped, or the person was picked up.
Bazlo: I want you guys to arrange yourself on the map. Who's up front? Who's behind? We're just going to use this as a... I'm an attack medalist. Arrange yourselves. I'm going to go... And move your characters up into here, let's say. I'm just going to get in a flanking position. Okay.
Bazlo: Penis formation, boys. And you guys are trying to backtrack, correct? This way? If that's backtracking, yes. Give me one second here. Cool. So, Theron...
Theron: As you begin to back into the fog, you begin to feel a heavy, heavy presence on your chest and you begin to feel exhausted and you take a point of exhaustion. We must hurry, gentlemen, for this is not easy. Well, perhaps we're supposed to be going forward and not back then.
Bazlo: we believe that the fog is guiding us shall we take another vote who would like to proceed and who would like to turn back i am still of the camp of trying to find this wayward soul i agree we have a mission and and if we find the man we find where a werewolf
Theron: I'd like to take five steps forward and see if I have the same issue that Theron is having. You do not. Though the fog seems to slightly give way and allow you to pass through. I'm going to message you on the side, Mike. What were you saying, Zach?
Bapef: I ask Bazlow, does it feel fine over there? All clear over here, boys. I'm not seeing any of that exhausting fog. If we all get fucked up with exhaustion, this is not going to be a good time. Perhaps we go to a place that doesn't try to kill us. Let's go get us some lichen.
Elzerios: So you guys decide to continue forward? I follow Baz though. To where? Follow the trail. I'm getting away from the shit that's trying to actively murder me because it's bad air.
Theron: Perfect. As you guys continue to go down this trail, are we looking for blood? Are we doing anything? What's the thought there? Hey, Pepper's looking at the trail, just trying to follow the path of the drag lines. Who's up front? I appear to be.
Theron: leading the way with my flute. So as you all continue to follow Baslow here, Baslow, as you continue stepping forward, you start to feel cobblestones under your feet. You notice it seems that you've come to a paved road. I've found a paved road, boys.
Theron: Is there anything on the ground? I'm checking the ground. Any new signs of blood? Give me an investigation check. That's four ones so far. I mean, you've got a seven and a two. It's not horrible. I feel like ones. Yeah, so you just noticed that it's cobbled. It's almost like it's a driveway.
Theron: Apef looks down and can I observe if there's any disturbance in the stones or did we just lose our trail? So Baslow is on the Pecables. Not everybody else is at this point. But as you all continue forward, you out of the woods and out of the mist start to see this townhouse in front of it. And there seems to be two children in front of it.
Theron: Now we introduce ourselves. Do we notice any difference in the fog or anything? The fog just slightly opens up. The house sits in the middle of this clearing, and you can see through the clearing, but all you see is the house and the mist behind you. We took a look. I lean over to Garton. What are children doing here?
Theron: You see the... Actually, give me a group perception check. Our town's still in Avernus. Sick.
Theron: Um, you all notice that it's a little boy and a little girl. They're both, um, the, the little girl seems to be a little bit older and is maybe a foot taller than the little boy. You see the little boy like squirming, uh, as they sit out in front of their house. Um, they seem both deeply, deeply sad.
Bazlo: Yeah, I'm not so good with social interactions. Perhaps somebody else can take the lead. I will approach the two boys. The boy and the girl.
Theron: You hear, as you begin to walk towards the front of this house, you hear a whimper from the little boy, and the little girl looks up at you, and the boy goes to say something, and then she shushes him. What's that, little lad? Go ahead and speak freely. The girl shushes the little boy again and says, There's a monster in our house.
Theron: She points to the building behind her in this case. The windows are dark. It has a gated portco on the ground floor. The rusty gate is slightly ajar. The woods on either side just seem to be dark and full of mist. A monster? Well, where are your parents?
Theron: They're up in the attic. They've been doing crazy things inside of the house. I think it's taken them. Oh, no. I take a knee by the children. Did you get a good look at them? At the monster? Yes, at the monster, of course. No, I just heard screams up in the top floor. This is troubling.
Bazlo: I stand back up on my two feet and look back to the group. There's work to be done here, gentlemen. The boy begins sobbing as you talk to his sister. What's going on, young man?
DM: He just buries his face into the sister's cloak. Okay, I see. Is there somewhere we can take you guys while we try to solve what's going on here? No, just wait out here. We just can't stand to go back into the house. I see. Do you have neighbors? Is there someone nearby that you know?
Theron: There's a village not too far from here, but there's no nearby neighbors, no. Okay. I would like to ask the little girl a question. Little lass, how many people preside in this house, aside from the monster? Well, there's my mom and dad, Elizabeth and Gustav, and there's a baby, Walter. I don't fucking trust these kids.
Theron: Me either. What do I gotta do to not trust these kids? Give me a perception check. Actually, give me an insight check, since you hold so fucking horribly on perception. Oh, that's better. Yeah? They are telling you the truth. I... want to look on the ground and see if there's a rock. About fist-sized.
Theron: About fist-size? Yeah, you look at the ground, and there's definitely a fist-size rock. Wanna throw it at the upstairs window. Okay. Give me an athletics check. No. You throw the rock, and it bounces off the window ledge. You see a little bit of stone crumple away as you throw the rock. Did you hear anything?
Muu: Well, you little ones are in luck because you have a whole group of monster hunters. I say we go check this out, see what we can get out of this. The monster may be our liking that we're looking for. What would you boys like to do? Baypef just nods and he's like, hmm, there's a child in danger. I'm on board. Sure, why fight him in the open when you can fight him in close quarters?
Albert: yeah i don't know that uh what we're seeing is a werewolf i feel like we would have heard them by now hmm perhaps yeah wants to listen after he says that yeah what do you want that
DM: give me a perception check 19 19 as you look around you absolutely can tell that you are not in the same place as you were when you were hunting werewolves the woods have changed the sky has changed you for all intents and purposes you are in a different land when you say the sky has changed
DM: Yeah, the sky is gray and dark, and it really hasn't got much brighter since daylight. Can you describe the trees for Bay Path? The trees seem to all be covered in moss. It seems like the clouds don't let up much here. Everything seems to be in a constant state of decay.
Theron: I leaned into the party. I made an observation once we began following this trail that the landscape here is quite foreign. It shouldn't exist around where we are right now. I suspect foul play. Yes, I suspect it as well.
DM: The little boy starts to sob harder, and the young woman looks up at you, please, you must help us, and starts pleading with you. Give me ten minutes, young girl. Lads, perhaps we are still in this dream. Did we ever wake up? Baypef, could you pinch me? Of course I can. I go up and I pinch him. Yeah.
Bazlo: As a constant, er, as a, uh... Not you, ABFist. Go ahead. As a ritual spell, I would like to cast Detect Magic. So you see me sit down in the middle of the group, and the small bead on my arm just turns into an orb, and you see me just looking into it, speaking some words for about ten minutes. Alright, while that ten minutes is happening, what is everybody else doing?
DM: pairing my flute to enter. I ask the little children, is the front door unlocked? I'm presuming it is. Yes, absolutely. I take a step towards the front door. I'm going to go twist the knob and open it. All right. The door just swings right open. Before you do that, with your magic, your tech magic, you do feel a faint trace of magic coming from the house.
Bazlo: Nothing that's alarming in any way, shape, or form. But something magical is inside the house. Yeah, I can say to the group, this is... You can't tell one way or the other. You just feel magic from the house itself. Yeah, I just tell the group that there's magic. That wasn't your check, bro. Oh, is that yours? My bad, I mixed them up. I want to walk up right next to Baypav. I want to knock...
DM: on the door and say hello is there anybody in there well it's already open it's open so he shouts into the empty door all right i would like to ask the child one more question before we go in absolutely let's last what is this place that we are in
Bazlo: I mean, you're in Barovia. Where else would you be? Perfect. That's all I needed to know. What in the fuck is Barovia? I've studied fucking lands and lands and books and books and tomes and tomes. What the fuck's in Barovia? Give me a history check.
Bazlo: I also say this out loud to the party. My history check is garbage. Well, I'm just the talker, so. Yeah, nothing of mine comes back to you, Albert. All the scrolls and scrolls and books and books can't help you here. What I will say to him... Because I was just so confounded. What I'll say to him, we are definitely not where we once were.
Bazlo: As I hear her say Barovia, Barovia of what? Of Barovia. Is this a continent? Is this a town? Is this an area? What are you? What do you call your planet? I mean, the same planets? We're not too far from Faerun? How does one get to Barovia?
DM: by carts or by horse, I suppose, walking. She begins to start getting more and more upset and nervous, and you can tell she's just being a scared, fragile child and doesn't really have time for all of your questions.
Bazlo: You just see Albert go into like a complete OCD moment where he's like, what the? I should know this. What do you mean? I'm just mentally losing my fucking mind that I don't have this information already. Perfect. That's great because I want you to pull up the short-term madness and I want you to give me a roll. Where's the short-term madness? Where do I find it? Short-term madness. Hold on. Five E. E.
DM: Give me a D100, please. I get fucking penalized for fucking trying to RP. This is just savage. It's in your character's nature. 37. Okay. Okay, so give me roll a 1D10 as well, too. Oh, no.
DM: Oh, God. Perfect. So you become frightened and, you know, each time. So if the character becomes frightened and you must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of fear. So in this case, it doesn't really affect you, but you are absolutely frightened by everything that is going on around you for the next ten minutes.
Bazlo: You just see fucking Albert, like, racking his mind, like, Barovia, Barovia, where the fuck, where, why haven't I heard of Barovia? And then you just start seeing him, like, shake, and like, uh, I know, I don't know. Can I do a perception check? The little boy comes up and runs next to you and starts crying with you, um, Alfred. And go ahead, Gio. Can I do a perception check to see if I can tell what, what the hell's going on between them two?
DM: Between who two? Between, um, not between them, but to them. To Albert and, uh... Albert and... And the little kid. I mean, sure. Would I know if Albert has any books on him? Say that again? Would I know if Albert has any books on him?
DM: books. Yep. Albert, do you carry your spell book out in the open? My spell book is tucked under my cloak. So no, you would not, Miles. Never mind. And Theron, you just see the little boy almost halfway comforting Albert as he has a slight mental breakdown. Albert, what's going on?
Bazlo: What do you mean? What do you mean, Barovia? The fey room, the coast of the fey... I've seen the maps. I've read through the data. It doesn't make sense. Where are... Have you heard of this place? No, I have not. There is foul play here. I can... I can tell. But... We will figure it out. We've either stepped into a pocket dimension somehow, or...
Bazlo: I don't know, but I should know, and I don't know why I don't know, why I couldn't sense that we got here. How did we get here?
Theron: Baypef begins to lose his patience off in the side you guys see him scratching at his hair fleas and other things start popping out of them and he begins to cast wild shape and as he does this his hair on his arms begin to grow longer
Theron: and his appendages begin to reshape into
Theron: shorter but much more palpable and and much more worthy arms of a beast of that couldn't run really fast and his hands begin to turn into Paul's and he begins to right in front of you guys turn into a dire wolf
Theron: He leans back as he's made this majestic transformation, turning into a dire wolf finally.
DM: looks back at you guys and goes and walks into the building in my state of chaos do i see him transform or do i suddenly see a dire we'll go ahead and say you have sobbed for the last 10 minutes and you see him transform okay um by the way ben um this house is very fucking big you can't really get around in it as a dire wolf as a heads up
DM: Hmm, interesting. How big is a direwolf? Yeah, what size creature is a direwolf? A direwolf's a pretty big fucking creature. And if you will all look at the bottom here of this map, just below the thing. Oh, shoot. Oh, there's a whole thing.
DM: yes um here so since we are going to be in close quarters before we start this just as a heads up um you guys can all uh occupy the same space um or two people can occupy the same space at the same time so we can do this one of two ways either each of you can pick a token or uh team up in teams of two and pick a token or you can all move your tokens individually um it's up to you but again it is cross quarters in this house
DM: I'll protect the wizard. I'll protect the wizard. Cool. So, um, Elzeros then, uh, and, um, Albert, you will, uh, pick your, or take Elzeros' token then? Does that work? Also, by the way, DM, uh, the picture you showed us, front door, very big.
Bazlo: Is the front door big? It's a gate. You see the space here, right? Like, let me show you how big a direwolf is. Direwolf is nine feet. Yeah, it's a big motherfucker. One block by two blocks, which could feasibly navigate here if you want to allow it. Oh, I had to refresh. That's an over-representation of a direwolf. That is what the direwolf takes up as far as space goes. Oh yeah, I gotcha. Just turn into a regular wolf or bear.
DM: Um, yeah, what I'm gonna do, can I revise that and just turn into a regular wolf? Yes, you can absolutely just turn into a regular wolf. Thank you, DM. Alright, so Albert and the ranger are going to be that. Who else is teaming up here, then? Pick me, pick me.
DM: This is not RP. This is just, hey, we're doing this for money. I'll take Theron with me. Theron, would you like to join me? I might be moving around independently from you if we get into combat. And that's fine. If that happens, just keep your token on the left-hand side as we go through this. Sure. So let's do Miru and Bay Path, and then I'll just follow. Yeah, we'll team up with Bazla. Yep, move your guys' off to the...
DM: Thank you. Wait, who's teaming up with me? Theron. Oh, okay. Alright. So, um, and you're first going in, babe? Yeah. So where's the door we entered from? Can you point to it? This is the door down here. Awesome. First things first, I'm gonna take a sniff.
DM: Perfect. So as you smell, it smells just like a house. It smells like there is a hearth fire that slowly died down. There seems to be a smell of like food and just, you know, a house like people have been living in it.
DM: As you guys all though start to walk into the foyer here The mist seems to creep up behind you and it is now engulfed the house again Like inside the house or just outside of it outside of the house, okay, I'm gonna Paul at the door in front of us Yeah, you you you're good though. You're in here. I
DM: Perfect. All right. So as you enter the foyer, ignoring a shiver, you escape the clinging mist and cross the storm portico into the house. A chill hangs in the air. The oaken doors stand before you. Silent and brooding, you find yourself in an immaculate foyer decorated with portraits and heraldry. A family of stony-faced aristocrats watch you with disinterest. The plaque on the frame reads The Dursts in dull gold lettering.
Bapef: On the southern wall, you find a shield emblazoned with a coat of arms, a gold windmill on a red field. I'm going to take a... I'm going to beckon my friends forward and take a look at these shields, move five feet north, and continue to look at these paintings. Yeah, go ahead.
DM: Are you going to, like, stare at them? Yeah, yeah. I want to see, like, perhaps if they're following me. Yeah, go ahead and give me a perception check.
DM: I watched too much Scooby-Doo as a kid. That's Haunted Mansion. 13. So you look at the shield and the picture of the Dursts in this case, and it really is just a bunch of, it's just a picture of them. They're stony-faced, like old-timey people taking a picture and not smiling together. But again, it really is just a foyer room with these pictures and that shield.
Bapef: You hear Baypef just let out a little and keeps going forward. I follow Baypef, peering around the room. Perfect. Are you going to open that door, I take it? Yep.
DM: Awesome. So as you open the door, the hinges squeak. It doesn't seem like there's been a shit ton of man attack here. Exactly. We'll just go ahead and close that real quick. So as you open this door, it's almost breathtaking.
DM: In the gloom beyond the foyer, the main hall glitters. Its wood panels are innately carved with idyllic scenes of frolicking nymphs and satyrs. At one end of the hall is a sweeping red marble staircase that climbs to unknown heights. In the other is a black marble fireplace, cold and unlit. Mounted above the mantel shelf is a longsword. A windmill cameo is worked into its hilt. Hmm...
DM: I'm gonna go and take a listen. I'm gonna take a step in the room and listen for sounds of struggle Yeah, give me a perception check No sounds of struggle no Nothing crazy sounds, you know horrible going on in here. It seems pretty quiet. I
Bapef: I, with a head nod, beckon my friends forward. Take a look at this fireplace, boys. I see the inscription in the sword. Is there anything I can discern from this? Any writing? So it's not really an inscription. Give me a history check.
DM: Okay, so you inspect this longsword and you notice that there's a windmill cameo. Same as the windmill that you saw in the foyer. All right, fellas, where should we check around first for this monster? Well, we can either sneak around here in the dark
Bapef: Or we can just scream and have the monster come to us. It'd be a good place to fight. I like that idea. I could play him an ugly song. Baypef walks in a circle and just sits.
DM: Grapef, with your perception, your passive perception, you see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs of that decorative paneling in the walls. Would I be able to send Silver out for a recon mission upstairs? I mean, sure, if you would like to.
Bapef: Yeah, let's send Silver out to go see what's upstairs. As you send Silver out, Baypuff is pawing at these symbols to get you guys to look at them on the wall. So, as you send out Silver, give me a perception check.
DM: As Silver flies up and flutters up this magnificent marble staircase, she comes to a room and she sees three
Bazlo: doors and four suits of what look like decorative armor i love how you guys made silver girl oh also dm i wanted to know and when i'm in this form can i speak to animals freely it's up to you speak to other wolves freely cool cool uh there's all way up there with armor i don't know
Albert: Euron, would you like to take a look at these symbols that Bapef is pawing at and maybe discern something from them with your religious background? Sure, I want to take a look at the symbols and see if I've seen them before. Are those the symbols up ahead of us?
Theron: Yeah, so the symbols are, like, woven into the wall, and I guess, Baypeth, we're just mending some gaps here into the meta. Bazlo, you see Baypeth as a wolf, like, scratching at these, like, skulls and things that are woven into the wood paneling. And for you, Theron, please give me a perception check.
DM: So, yeah, Theron, you just see that these are bats and skulls woven into the decoration. You think to yourself, hmm, not my choice of decor, but, you know, if it works for others. Right, yeah, I foresee no symbolism in these symbols, Basil. I think just some people are drawn to the darker side of art. Don't know why, but I have met some
Albert: So, Albert, how about we have your bird maybe go start some commotion upstairs, take down a few of these suits of armor, test them out. What do you say? We can definitely try to do that. Also, just quick clarification, is there a reason I can't see anything over there? I got Baypev and a wolf on the screen. See where?
Bapef: On the... So we pulled one out of two characters to just represent it as a smaller group. Okay, but I can't... So they're just sitting over there idle right now. Yeah, the fog of war is still on top of... Oh, here. Well, this... See... Oh, not that. I can see. It's fine. Yeah.
Bazlo: like that is that what you're asking for oh okay but i have a wolf and me so no you are the wolf yeah yeah okay so push the wolf token in place of your character exactly that's what i wanted to clarify yeah yeah yeah no we're just using this because it's really cramped in here and i don't want uh yeah so uh
Bapef: So you guys have five doors in front of you, a marble staircase. What do you want to do? I have silver on my shoulder, and I give him a little rub on the head. I'm like, silver, I need you to go knock down some suits of armor. Let me see. Remember, you're a dragon, not an owl.
Theron: So you want to go knock down the suits of armor upstairs? Correct. Okay, cool. Cause a little commotion. Give me an athletics check. Per silver. Okay, so that is strength based. Yes. So it's this minus four.
Theron: So that's 13. Not bad. Okay, cool. So as Silver flies up to these suits of armor, she knocks off one of the helmets, or it, whatever, knocks off one of the helmets and knocks off another helmet. You all hear a loud clanking coming down from the floor up above you, but really nothing else.
Bapef: Baypef, not knowing what Elzeros exactly did, because in this form he can't understand, he's like, That was Albert. Albert, okay. That was Silver flying upstairs, commanded by Albert. Calm down, boy, calm down. It was just the bird. I go up to Baypef as Silver lands on my shoulder, and I give him a head scratch.
Theron: And I'm like, I was going to say, you hear a slight creaking coming from inside of the room next door. You guys hear that? Hello. Is there anybody there? I point towards the door.
Bazlo: Alright, let me clarify something again. This is not contextually making any sense where the tokens are and what I'm looking at. Seems like they're on outside of the wall. You are the wolf token. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. You're on Anabas. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but Albert is off to the side. Okay, so those tokens each represent two people.
Bazlo: gotcha oh my goodness i you explain that you explain that and i was like i get that okay all right never mind i was like this doesn't make any sense wolf brain is not as strong as human brain so i point the dome
Bapef: Why are there other characters way outside the building? You know, at least he's dumb in wolf form, but at least he does his smell. You know what? He does smell brand new. Oh, Jesus Christ. Alright, so I point Baypef to this door right here. Yes. I walk up to the door and point on it and give it a push with my paw.
Albert: You stay right there, wolf. I would like to cast Mage Hand. Okay. You cast Mage Hand. Yeah, I would like to cast Mage Hand on the door to go ahead, open the door, and head in before we do. Okay. You open the door, and it opens up.
Bazlo: That's gonna be a clip. Apef, get him.
Theron: Wait. Yeah, what do I see? Yeah, yeah. So who's going in first? It's the wolf? Of course. Okay, which is actually kind of cool. So out from the darkness looms wolves, their snarls frozen and forevermore. A stag's head is mounted above the unlit fireplace. Fine chairs draped in furs face the hearth with a cask of wine and a pipe rack on the table between them.
Theron: The goblets are dry and empty, but seem to have been set. The candelabra gleaming in the lamplight. The wax is melted over, leaving a white island on the table. So there's a nice pool of wax on the table as well, too. Cabinets line the wall. In one of the dark corners of the room, a chandelier hangs over a cloth-covered table.
Bazlo: The room is dark in here, by the way. And I'm a wolf, so I can see. Yep. Right? I snarl. And I take a step towards one of the wolves. Give me a perception check. And that snarl is to alert my friends, to be specific. Okay.
Theron: Not as her dominance. That's what I thought. Even in your wolf form, you're still not silly enough to fall for that these are just seem to be stuffed wolves. I turn back to them and my tail starts wagging. False alarm. I would like to follow wolf path into the room.
Theron: There definitely was a break in this room, so something's in here or above here. I'm gonna walk in and take a sniff. So as you walk in, you start to hear a harpsichord playing from up above you. It's playing a somber tune, and it seems to be echoing down the hallways. Hmm.
Theron: is the fireplace lit nope it is it's a pretty dark room in here the windows are covered as well too so if you do not have um uh night vision then you can't see deep dark into this or deep into this room can i cast light on uh bay path here um can you cast light on an actual like uh animate object
Bazlo: I think it's on an item. I think it has to be on an item. Meanwhile, I'm going to do the dog point at the fireplace. I'm assuming is where most of the sound is coming from. Can I tell? Give me one second. What were you going to do, Danny? Then I would like to cast light on my crystal that I'm holding in my hand, which is my arcane focus. Perfect.
Bapef: it um so you you cast uh light on this and you know light starts to flood into the room um yeah so you you now can see and go ahead ben sorry so i'm gonna point at the fireplace um and actually i'm going to walk up to the fireplace and see if i can hear that song louder
DM: Absolutely. So as you approach the fireplace, you can absolutely hear it coming down through the fireplace. I'm just going to point at the fireplace. Paul bent and point. Tail straight. Since I'm with Baypef, is there anything I can do to check the mantelpiece for any pushable bricks or pullable levers or anything like that?
Bapef: Yeah, absolutely. Give me an investigation check. Sure.
Bapef: There's a seven. Perfect. So as you begin to, like, pat down the mantle and you lead yourself over to some of the cabinets looking for, like, switches and things like that, you come across a locked cabinet. In the north cabinet, it just opens right up and you see a deck of playing cards and an assortment of wine glasses. So this one here is locked. There are...
Theron: no uh switches or anything that you can see within here with your roll um but yeah there's a locked cabinet right here or here excuse me cool i would like to approach that west cabinet and um unlock it cool do you have thieves tools oh gosh can i just shove my pen in there my ink pen no i do not
Bapef: No, you either you either get them at character creation or you got to get them. Okay. Oh, oh, oh, Ferrios and Theron, what are you guys doing out in the main foyer here? Observing.
Bazlo: Bay Path, I'd like to take a look. Is this fireplace something that you think a wolf could fit into and try to put his back against and climb up? No. Okay. I'll give you a point of inspiration, a 1d4 for even asking the question. Dude, that was my first thought. I was like, yo, I'm fucking Santa Claus. Let's go.
Theron: That's great. I'm just looking around and trying to take everything in. I'm watching the stairs since the kids said the thing was upstairs. Cool. Perfect. I would like to ask my party. Do any of you fellows have these tools? I believe you can open a lock. I don't think so. I do not. I do not. Locked, it will remain.
DM: What's it made out of? Can you describe this? Can you describe this? I'm sorry, what? Somebody can try to beat through it. Yeah, that's what I said. Can you describe this cabinet again for us? Yeah, I mean, cabinets lined the wall. They're made of wood. They're ornate looking in this case, but it's just a wooden cabinet with a lock on it. What interests you about this particular cabinet?
Theron: I just think that a couple of locked cabinets might be worth looking into. Maybe doing an arcane check on with one of you fancy arcane fellows. Arcane check? What's that? I guess, do I feel like there's anything magical locked behind this lock?
Bapef: Give me an arcane check. What a question. I am dog shit today. You do not feel any magic coming from behind the cabinet. It is just a cabinet, even with your arcana check being so low.
Bazlo: Bay Path, sadly, having heard that he cannot climb up the chimney and hearing that the noise is coming from upstairs, is going to immediately turn around and pitter patter to the staircase and point. Before I leave the room, I would like to go ahead and grab that deck of playing cards out of the chest.
Bapef: And then I will follow, if your run wants to follow. So we're all going up the stairs, then? Yes, sir. Yes. All right, cool. Let me just go ahead and do this real quick. I wish you could just create scenes, man, so that way I could just, like, click something off.
Bazlo: Hopefully, I don't know. I haven't checked the... What's it called? The path that they're trying to do. But they have shadows you can apply to certain people coming up. Oh, that's actually nice. So it can be like, you see this, but nobody else can see it. Oh, that's going to be so nice. Alright. So, you guys are more than welcome to walk your asses up the stairs. Let's do it.
Bapef: Can we hear the music any louder? Yes, absolutely. So as you hear, or as you guys walk up the stairs, you continue to hear the harpsichord playing, and it is coming from... I'm going to walk up to the door and knock.
Bapef: Hello, is there anybody in there? So let me give you guys a good description of the area you guys just walked up into real quick here. So a cold giraffe sweeps down for the marble staircase as it delivers you to a darkened hall.
Bapef: Above the mantelpiece hangs another portrait of the family. It looks like the children both smiling down at you. The mother, her face darkened with a hint of scorn. Goddamn children! Cradles a swaddled baby. Two mahogany doors are intricately carved with dancing youths. Suits of armors flank these doors, clutching spears. Their gaze empty beneath wolf-shaped visors.
Bapef: A third door stands to the right of the stairs, which continue climbing upwards. So, you want to knock on said door here? Yes. And there is no answer. But music keeps playing. Yeah, absolutely. I have a question for the team. Does anyone believe that these suits of armor could possibly harm us in any way?
Bazlo: Baypef would like to take a paw and push one of these statues over. Give me an athletics check. And two of them already have their helmets knocked off. 17.
Bapef: so you easily push this pile of armor over and a large clattering hits the ground as this wolf pushes it over the harpsichord in the other room stops I almost called myself caboose the wolf just goes I'm gonna knock again hello is there anybody in there
Theron: There is no answer. This is quite odd, gentlemen. Alright, who's going into the creepy room? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Um... I say we find the parents first. How about we check the room that doesn't have creepy music coming from it? Clear that first. The music has stopped since he pushed over that, uh... Yeah. I, um... He's still coming. Came. Sorry, past tense.
Bapef: And so just to give a little more ambiance to the only light in this room is coming from Muju's... My light spell? Yep, your light spell. I say we continue up. Damn, tough decision.
Bazlo: Baypeth is going to walk forward, stand up on his hind legs, and put all his weight on the door. To open it. Alright. So, um...
Bapef: So as you push this door open, you see the harpsichord directly in front of you, looms out from the dark. The cracks of Muju's light just slowly filter into the room as you open this door. The brass-plated chandelier casts
Bazlo: dull sheen from uh from his lamplight as it half uh as if to half-heartedly warn you away the fireplace lies cold decorated by alabaster figurines of dancers neatly plated on the mantelpiece velvet upholstered chairs line the walls for those that would be serenaded with what would be no doubt beautiful music it's lonely here the chill hangs in the air
Elzerios: I do not like the ambiance of this room. Baypiff, with that shuddering description, is going to look over to Bazlo and be like, What is it? What is it? Do you not want to go in there? Yeah, my tail is between my legs.
Theron: Aslo would like at the sight of these beautiful instruments My father had one of these before I'd like to maybe take a look in this room and See what we got here Absolutely, is anyone else technically going to join him?
Bazlo: No. Alright. You see the... Just, you know, it's an empty room with a harpsichord and very fine chairs and some carvings above the fireplace. At the sight of none of my teammates helping me or coming in with me, my legs begin to quake. And I immediately exit the room.
Theron: What'd you see? Uh, I saw Jack, Jack and the other boys, not a single thing, just, uh, just got more creepy the closer I got. Quite, quite eerie. Well, there's another room on this floor. Let's look for the life. There's many rooms below us, and there's two floors above us. I would like to check over here, are these, is this another door to our north? Yep, that is absolutely another door to your north.
DM: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we must remember we are in someone's home, so it is best we find the owners. Are we in their home in America or in their home in Europe?
Bazlo: what i mean is the fog enveloped the house as soon as you stepped in and you didn't hear the children say anything so you are in a big dark creepy mansion um and you're finally you're trying to find a monster
Elzerios: Baypeth is going to do the same thing he did for the last room. He's going to go up on his back legs and put all his weight forward on his front paws and push the door open. So, you know, with this one, the door is actually shut, so little wolf paws can't push it open. I just keep continuing to call on him. The child did say the parents were in the attic.
Theron: eye, but perhaps we find some clues or something to help us out along the way. Okay. Maybe even another child. True. Okay, well. As long as we're not breaking things, I guess that's okay. I look over to Baypath the wolf and just kind of push him back a little from the door and tell him I've got this, boy. I've got this. I've got fingers. I go ahead and I open it.
Theron: And I try to slowly, quietly push the door open. Do you have darkvision? I do, as a half-elf. Double-check.
Bazlo: Oh yeah? So again, as you open this door, the light trickles in from Muju's spell. Here is a place of a great study. A wealth of knowledge sits on the floor to ceiling bookshelves, weighty tomes of untold worth, novels, treatises, encyclopedias, poetries, histories.
Bazlo: So vast is this library that a rolling ladder is necessary to reach the high shelves. An exquisite desk faces the hearth. Upon the mantelpiece thereof hangs a framed portrait of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Two reading treers flank the fireplace, stuffed and lovely and inviting. This place, quite frankly, terrifies the hell out of me. I don't like books so much.
Bazlo: Can I take a closer look at this windmill? Yeah, absolutely. Give me an investigation check. While he's doing that, I hear books, and I feverishly go inside. Yeah, you look at this windmill, and it just seems to be an insignia of some sort for the Durst family. Hmm.
Albert: And what were you going to go do, Albert? As soon as I heard books, I feverishly go inside and start looking through all the books intently because I'm looking for a spell book. Albert just loves knowledge, right? Perfect. Let me see here real quick. Yeah, so give me an investigation check.
Bazlo: Perfect. You start flowing through all of these tomes. Some of them seem to be first editions. Some of them seem to be first editions in this case. You start reading through them and it's all of the greats of knowledge that you've ever loved and heard of. This library is literally just filled to the brim with knowledge.
Albert: I want to take as many books as I feasibly can, and I would also like to ask my party members to take a bunch of books. Anyone want very much books? Guys, guys, look at all this. Look at all... I need all of this. These are somebody... Somebody owns these books. Perhaps we find them and ask them if we may borrow them for a while.
Albert: I'll just look Albert greatly in the eyes and say, you get one. Okay. For right now, I want to look for what I think will be the best book. Okay. Give me an investigation check. Hold on. I got eight.
Albert: Oh, I want to use lucky. Recharge is lucky. So I want to use lucky. Okay. For a 21. 21. All right, cool. Let's see here. I'm looking for a specific tome.
Bazlo: You can, we can just play this post if you don't want to do it right now. Um, no, it's okay. Um, actually we can take a break real quick while I look this up. Um, so let's take five if that sounds good. Oh, sure.
Bazlo: So as you pull that tome away, and I'm about to DM you the tome here, but you hear a slight click and a secret room opens up as you pull this specific tome away. Oh. Can I see where it opened?
Bapef: Uh, this was not my intent, but it would seem that the best book on the shelf... ...opens something?
Bazlo: One second. So the bookshelf swings open, hidden hinges squeal in the gloom. Dusty shelves line the wall of a cramped room, packed with tomes decorated in only eldritch rooms and ominous symbols. You spot a heavy chest at the end of the hall, squatting as if it harbors some coveted secret, a secret worth dying for, apparently. If the skeleton in the rotting leathers is any clue to the insidious danger you've all found yourself in.
Albert: Oh, shit. Why don't you go in and check it out, wizard? No, that's not my job. I opened it. Somebody else has to go look at it. Baypef, in his senses, were you guys trying to get me to open it?
Theron: No, Muju walked in. Sorry, I was muted. I said I would go look at it. Perfect. Before he goes, I'm going to walk over
Bapef: the Muju you truly are a hero and cast heroism on them how long does it take to cast heroism one action it's not a ritual
Bapef: And I'll read it for you, Muju. A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Is that going to be... Plus three. Plus three, yeah. So, when the spell ends, the target loses any remaining hit points from the spell.
DM: Perfect. Okay. Yeah. That's it for now. Okay. All right. What are you doing? Can I cast guidance on myself? Sure. Okay. Cool. Will that cancel the heroism or no? No, because it's his concentration and it's your concentration. Versus my concentration. Okay. Cool. What do you do as you cast guidance on yourself?
Albert: I bow my head and close my eyes and in long arcing circles bring my hands together at my center.
DM: And then after I finish casting the spell, I try to investigate the altar that this crumpled, leather-borne skeleton is huddled at. Perfect. So as you closely inspect the skeleton, you see that there's three darts stacking out of the Dead Adventurer's armor and ribcage.
DM: clutching the skeleton's left hand. You see a familiar seal and a letter. He's clutching a letter with a seal. Okay. Am I able to turn around and try and find the source of the darts in the skeleton as I look at all the walls and all the furniture in the room? Give me an investigation check. Okay.
DM: So as you start to investigate the scene you actually look down in the chest and notice that there's a depressed Switch no more darts are gonna be firing out of this. I See okay great After realizing that I
DM: Uh, cautiously approach the skeleton and look through its leather garb for anything of use. Um, so you see nothing on the skeleton itself besides the actual leather armor and as well as the note that it's clutching. Okay, then I will reach for the note. Cool.
Albert: Yeah, you got the note. You have it. As you are looking around though, there are books and things everywhere as well. Can I do some sort of arcane check to find the right book that would benefit me or my party member? Something that's maybe laced with magic.
DM: Um, so, uh, no, but you can take a look at the books themselves. Okay, then I will do that. Cool. As you start to read over these books, you see the names. In the light of the Ossibus. Rituals of the Lifecaller. Heart of Midnight. Okay.
DM: Fantastic Devils and Where to Find Them. A gnarled tome in an infernal that can be translated as Got 99 Problems and a Demon Ain't One. Alright. How many books can I take? You can take as many as you want. Then I will take...
Albert: I'll take three of them. The 99 problems. What was the second one you said? Rituals of the Lifecaller. Rituals of the Lifecaller and the Midnight one. Heart of Midnight. Cool. Yes.
DM: So as you take these books and you open them up and start to flip through the pages, you read through, and it seems like these tomes are made for summoning fiends and rituals of necromancy of the priest called Ossipus. Ossipus. Okay. Do I...
DM: I recall that name appearing again. Do I look back at the shelf and look for another book with Ossipus in the title? Yeah, yeah. There is a book called In the Light of Ossipus. All of them, though, seem to be written by these individuals of Ossipus. Okay. Okay.
Albert: Uh, then I snag that one last book, and then I make my way back to the party and announce my discoveries. Perfect. Um, so, yeah. What are you guys gonna do with these books? You find me. I found some tomes about some dude named Ossibus, and, uh, seems like a pretty crafty dude.
Elzerios: I might be interested in scouring these later. When the time is right, of course. I don't think so. This is a very good book indeed. I have chosen my one, but I will have to ask the onerous if I can browse through the others.
DM: Baypeth puts his paws together in a praying stance, and he's like, very nice, very nice. I want to walk up, and what else do I see in there? Yeah, you just see more books that still line some of the cabinets. You do see that there's an empty chest as well.
Bapef: I'm going to walk up to it. It's open and empty and nothing's in there. Go ahead and give me an investigation check again.
DM: Cool. So scattered about in the room, you also see a couple of other pieces of paper. As you pick them up and look at them, it seems to be the deed to this house and a deed to a windmill and a signed will. The windmill referred in the deed is...
DM: So it seems to just be some deeds and a signed will. They're both signed by Gustav and Elisabeth Durst. And it bequeaths the house, the windmill, and all other family property to Rosvalda and Thornbert Durst in the event of their parents' deaths. I presume these are the children I said to myself.
Bapef: I'm going to take these for now. Might not keep them, but I'm going to take these documents and go back to my party. Cool. I presume that the rest of the party could be hear any of this or see anything that happened in that room. If you guys can role play it out that you're sharing it with one another, yeah. Okay. What have you got there?
Bazlo: It appears to be the deeds to the house, but more importantly, it is the names of those individuals that live here. It is the Dursts. He puts his paw down to the ground and then touches his face and then does that multiple times. Down to the ground and to his eyes, most importantly.
DM: I'm going to lay the documents on the ground in front of Baypef. And the name on the documents is what? So the name on the documents are Gustav and Elizabeth Durst, and it bequeaths the house, the windmill, and all other family property to Rosivalda and Thorn Durst. Isn't Fred Durst the person we were trying to save?
Bapef: We're trying to save Fred Durst. No, I think, here, let me tell you who that was. I don't know if anybody knows who Fred Durst is. Jimmy Blacksmith, Laura, Contract for Werewolf, Thoradin, Barov, Stratovich. Yeah, I don't have that name right now. You're telling me that there's documents of a will to the two children outside. Yeah. What were the names of the children again?
Theron: I have an assessment lads Is it possible that there's some fair play there's some foul play here and maybe these two kids
Bazlo: born of other folks who may do crappy things possibly sent this monster upon their parents to recover this house in their will. Baypev goes, They seemed honest when we spoke to them. Yeah. But I do suspect foul play here. The children seem to... Yeah. Let's explore. Have we opened the room to the south yet?
Theron: You have not opened the room to the south yet. Yes we have. We walked barely in. Barely in. This one, or are you talking about the one you're next to? The one we're next to.
Theron: Those would be the northern rooms, correct? Yeah, you haven't opened that other... Oh yeah, you've opened anything that you can see that you've opened. There was a door right next to your other token now. Right here. Oh, I can't see that. I can't see it either. I'm going to walk to... Sorry, go ahead. You're good. I'm going to walk to the window and open it. Which window? Just this one right here.
Theron: Okay, cool. As you open the window, all you see is mist around you, and that's it. I don't see the kids at the front of the house? No, you can't see through this impenetrable mist in front of you. Okay then, never mind. PayPep is going to walk up to this door right at the top of the staircase and point.
Theron: Yes, I believe we should follow the wolf. Also, I would like to listen for signs of struggle. Cool. Give me a perception check. That's big wolf ears. Eleven. Eleven. You can't hear anything coming from the other side of this room. Cool.
DM: What do you think, boy? Are you trying to open the door or do you need a hand? And Baypef goes up on his hind legs, puts his body weight into the door and tries to open it.
Theron: Cool. As you swing the door open, the room is dusty and undecorated. Two lumpy straw-filled mattresses sit on worn-out bed frames, from under which Footlocker's room. Servant's uniforms hang in the open closet. The dumb waiter yawns like a tired youth with no knowledge of what's left in its head. This is an actual waiter person, or this is an image?
DM: A dumbwaiter. You know what a dumbwaiter is? I work on these professionally. It's a baby elevator. Baby elevator. If it's inaccurate, I'm gonna call you out, bud. It's a baby elevator. I'd like to walk up to the dumbwaiter, and is it at this level?
Theron: So it is not at this level. But if you look at that, that's the closet you're next to. The dumbwaiter is actually just over here. But as you inspect this dumbwaiter, you see a little bell. I reach my paw out and I tap it. Cool. As you give me a perception check.
DM: Seven. You hear a faint bell ringing from below you. Was it after I rang it or at the same time? Yeah, it was after you pushed it, about the same time. Hmm. Hmm.
DM: I'm gonna go back over to the door that I'm assuming is open. That Bazalus can hear me from, and go, Oh, oh! What you got, boy? I follow the wolf into the room. And I'm gonna ring the bell again. Another little bell rings down below you. I'm gonna inspect around. Is there any sort of lever, anything I can do to operate this lift?
Theron: As you look into it, or as you look at the dumbwaiter, you do see like a rope pulley system. Step aside, boy. Let's see what we got on the other end. I grab the pulley and I begin to bring it towards us. You just hear creaking as this, I guess, cart comes up through the dumbwaiter and there's nothing in it.
DM: upstairs. Oh, that's creepy enough. Um, we should Bapef is going to insist on getting on the lift. As you as you pull it up and it's level, I'm going to try to climb in. The dumbwaiter is too small for a wolf to fit inside.
DM: Not fancy enough, alright. Yeah, let's hook up with this wolf and just try to get into things. I'mma climb in... Yeah, climbing world, destroying wolf. Well, I don't think that'll work, boy. Let's try the stairs. Baypef attempts to get into the dumbwaiter, but he can't get his shoulders past, and he backs up, and he's like... Alright. And the bell was coming from below, correct?
Bazlo: Yes, it was coming from below. Someone lead us up these stairs. Let's head upstairs. I would like to go upstairs if the rest of you are in agreeance. Aye. Alright, so we are going up the stairs then, yeah? Yep.
Theron: Alright, you guys will have to look up and to the left. Do you all see where I'm at? Yep.
Theron: So, all right.
Theron: So the red marble staircase delivers you to its full height. The third floor, the air is choked with dust. The walls carved with autumn woodland scenes are mounted by the unlit oil lamps. An infant's cry cuts the silence into the tattered chunks while the cobweb suits of armor stand eternally vigilant in front of you.
DM: i would like to send silver out on a scouting mission um just as a heads up it's you guys are in a room all the doors are closed yeah yes the doors are closed yeah uh vapef would like to take a sniff in it listen
Theron: Gotcha. What are you going to be sniffing at? There's two suits of armor here. I'm going to sniff for humanoids, and I'm going to listen for struggle. Give me a perception check.
Theron: Nat 20. Gotcha. So you don't hear or sniff anything besides old dust. Nothing in the background. There's no noises being made anywhere. I'm going to approach the armor and just take a look at it. See if there's anything wrong.
Theron: It is just, you know, as you look at it, it is just two suits of armor. I want to look up at the ceiling and look to see if there's any sort of attic type doors. A ceiling? Yeah. You see a ceiling. Okay. Well, I presume this is the attic.
Theron: there's still another stair up in there this is the the top four and actually you know what um you um not you uh you actually noticed that there is a secret door uh in the west wall uh yeah
DM: I am going to paw at that door. Give me one second.
Theron: So you easily push it open, and you find stairs. Cobweb-filled stairs, which lead upwards. I'm going to turn backwards towards my companions as I paw at this door and it opens. I'm going to walk through it, lean back, and go, Ah, good work, boy. There's the attic. Attic. Theron and I follow. Okay.
Bapef: I'm going to head up. Hold on, Mr. Wolf. Go back to where you were. Baslow, stand right there where you're at. And I'm going to need you all to roll initiative here in a second. Hell yeah, partner. Go.
Elzerios: That's before that happens. You kind of see Albert trying to walk back down the stairs to get a look at more books. Two, two. Horse, horse. The only one that notices that is zero, but. All right. Oh, I should drop the real initiative.
Bapef: Not yet. Oh. Actually, yes. Roll initiative. You're good. Everybody, 21, 19. That's all you guys, right? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I'm 21.
Bapef: Yeah, it's really good at, if you roll before you start, just popping the integers in there. All right, perfect. So, Baslow, though, you are going to be surprised. So, as this, as the door opens and, you know, Mr. Wolf here takes a step up there. Oh, man. I'm going to knock this one over. Okay.
Bapef: Animated Armor BA goes ahead and takes a swing at you, Baslow. You're on this here as well, but I guess that would be me. You're there for now. Sweet. Okay. Natural 20. Okay, stop.
Bapef: Who did that? Baslow, you take 13 damage. Oh, lord. Cool. And then Animated Armor B is going to step up here at Elzeros. And let's see here. 13 and misses, Elzeros. Okay, Muju, it is your turn. Okay.
Bapef: And Muju, who are you with? Are you with his... I'm with... No, I'm with Baypiff. Okay, cool. So I can't go to Basil's tile because there's two people in that tile, right? So you can absolutely pass through his tile. You can pass through him. So if you want to actually just go ahead and drag yourself or your tile, let me just go ahead and open up the Fog of War real quick. Is this where you want to move? Um...
Albert: So you're here if you want to move it wherever you want to. Okay, yes. I will move... I can't go past because I get Attack of Opportunity, right? Correct, yes. Okay.
Albert: Well then, uh, oh, yep, I will definitely move right here, and I will cast, uh, what is it? I'll use my breath weapon on number A, oh, the letter A. What's that look like? Number A. Number A.
Albert: you that blue cone what's that look like describe you casting your spell yeah so i jump past baslo land in between the two constructs and i throw my head back with jaw wide open inhaling my chest doubles inside his eyes and i let out a giant bellow
Albert: throwing blue flame dealing incredibly cold damage to the contract. Perfect. And roll for hit. That was just the damage. You gotta roll for a hit, don't you? I don't see a hit. It's an 11 constitution. Oh, it's an 11 constitution? Yes.
DM: all right and he fails and takes eight damage theron is your turn yeah give me one second um so i have channel divinity i can turn on that but i'm not one i don't want to focus that real quick um but i have this other thing channel divinity bomb a piece
DM: And as far as I can tell, the Turn Undead I can do once per short rest, Embalm of Peace I can do a limited amount of times. I'm about to Google this. Because there's like, in the description, there's clear restrictions on Turn Undead, but not against Embalm of Peace.
Bapef: If you're using one of your channel divinity points, I imagine that you can only use it. You're using that point, yeah. Yeah. Because what does all my...
DM: hashtag geo's turn so as an action you can move up your to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks and when you move within five feet of any creature during this action you can restore two d6 plus three hit points to that creature a creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action yeah so you're using your channel divinity you only have one point right
Bapef: Yeah. Yeah, so if you use this, it uses your balm, or your divinity balm. Divinity? Okay. Good to know. Well, I'm not going to do that. Yeah, during this action, when you move within five feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to duty six. So yeah, essentially, if you were to move next to people who were injured, you would heal them all. Right, right. Yep. Okay. Um...
DM: Well, I'm not going to do that. I am going to walk up to my... Well, I guess I'm, like, stuck on my homie, Baslow. Don't worry, brother. I got you. And I touch him and heal him for... I'm sorry. Only for... I'm...
DM: I swear I'm stronger than that. I can feel it a little bit, but it just kind of tickles. And then I'm going to look at this animated armor and roll to hit. Doesn't that take up a... I can do it as a bonus action. Gotcha. 14 does not hit. 14 does not hit? Yep.
Bapef: Um... Hold on. Yeah, I'm just gonna stay right there. Alright, cool. So, uh, animated armor A's turn again after the surprise round. Also, you rolled an unarmored strike, by the way.
Elzerios: Yeah, I know, because I need one hand free to get items. Oh, from my pouch. Should I? I'm sorry. It's your turn. Yeah, that's what I was asking. I would like to fire bolt at Eddie. Cool. And where are you firing from? I am teamed up with zero.
Bapef: Okay, perfect. You're going to fire a day. Go for it. Yep. Since you are a little bit more... I'm not going to hit anyways. Yep. Bonus action crime. And that's my turn. Cool. All right, so...
Bapef: A is going to look at you Theron and he's gonna go ahead and just try to slam you and I think 19 hits and you are going to take 18
Bapef: damage they're on. Bay Path, it is your turn. I'm going to run right here and attack with advantage. Oh, pack tactics, yes. It's weapon attack plus four. Let's see.
Bapef: Oops, I didn't do an advantage. Does that hit? I'm going to roll again just to see if I crit. Yes, and so it does hit. And then the damage is... 2d4 plus 2. 2d4 plus 2. Damage. So that's 7.
Albert: Seven damage, you said? Yep. I pounce over to the edge of my companions. I lash out with my claws and just... Perfect. Zero, it is your turn. Me? Yes. Oh, he said zero. I was like, what? Zero. What's your name? Zero. Okay.
Albert: I'm going to stabby stab the armor in front of me. Cool. 18. 18 hits? Yeah. 8 damage. Perfect. Is that your turn? Yeah, I'll stay where I am. Awesome. Baslow, it is your turn. Um...
Elzerios: How is A looking? Can I tell? It looks like a dented suit of armor to you. Okay. I am going to go ahead and... I'm gonna use Healing Word. So I bring my flute up to my lips weekly.
Elzerios: and begin to play my healing song, which sounds very similar to hop cross buns. And. And I roll a six. All right. Six. And then I would like to use a bonus. Who does that heal? Everybody himself. So just me.
Elzerios: Um, bonus action. Oh. I can't use my dagger until I use my rapier, so I will unarm strike. I'll punch with my other hand a... punch the suit of armor. It is a six hit. No, no it is not. I shake that off a little bit and end my turn. Shaking his hand. Ow! Ow!
Theron: Muju, it is your turn. All right, I am going to cast my Thunderclap cantrip at the construct A. Thunderclap, I think, has a... Thunderclap! Thunderclap has, like, a thing.
Theron: I think that's Thunder Wave you're thinking of. Yeah, this one does this. Yeah, Thunder Wave is the level one spell that does mine. And if you use Thunder Crab, you have to RP that. Well, I'm from European descent, so I pronounce my L's with the L sound. The R sound? The R sound, no. The hit is 13 Constitution. Got it.
Albert: Oh man, let's see. And this is B? Or A? A. Ooh, and he fails. Okay, then I'll roll the 1d6 for damage. And it is a 3 damage.
Theron: So I raise my crystal in the air and you start to see this small dust swirl around the Construct A and seemingly out of nowhere a loud boom echoes through the chamber and A stumbles as it takes damage.
Albert: Perfect, yeah. As soon as you cast the spell, it starts to accumulate like a small crackling inside of his breastplate, and you see the breastplate like push out ever so softly. Awesome. And now it is Animated Armor B's turn, and he is going to try to slam you, Albert. Okay.
Albert: And does an 18 hit? Yes, it does. And you take 3 damage. It is now your turn, Albert. Is it? Yes. Uh...
Bazlo: Since he just tried to strike me, I am going to have to cast a bolt at him. Firebolt. At B? Yeah. That'll be at disadvantage because you're at range. Okay, well, here's another one to get lower than a 12, and it's a net 20. Hold on. I'm going to use Lucky. Okay.
Bazlo: And Lucky lets me get to pick which one of the three rolls I want to use, and I'll use the crit. Cool. So I don't even have to roll again. Is that a cantrip or an actual spell slot? Just curious. Firebolt's a cantrip. But Lucky, is that a spell slot or a cantrip? That's a feat. A feat. It acts on its own. So five damage as a crit, which is kind of garbage, but B gets crit, and let me mark off Lucky.
Albert: Yeah, that's your second one, correct? Yep. Awesome. Alright, as you shoot this firebolt at the suit of armor, it splashes against its breastplate and just like smolder comes up from its chest. I'm happy with it. Theron, it is your turn. Okay. Look at Bazlo. He looks a lot better.
DM: So I am going to cast Word of Radiance on the armor right in front of me. And what is my word, actually? Hold on. Sobis. And give me a constitution 13 chunk. And he doesn't make it. Max damage. Huge.
Albert: huge and i'm gonna end my turn cool it's just like scorched uh with with radiant light as as you uh say whatever word that was so this animated armor a is gonna take a look at bay path um and make a swing does this change does what form change your ac by chance it does not okay
Bapef: as far as i can tell it doesn't got it um and he misses his first one i think it does i think you take on the abilities of the wolf oh you're absolutely correct and it's the same as mine so doesn't make any difference yeah so uh he is 13 actually a 13 so the the arm or the
Albert: The wolf, or excuse me, the suit of armor looks at you and grabs you and slams you against his breastplate and you take eight damage. Cool. Does that come with any other flavor of stuff? What do you mean? Slam? Nope, nothing else. Okay. Yeah. All right. And it is your turn, babe. I take eight damage.
Bapef: Cool. I'm going to use a bonus action to burn a spell slot and heal myself for 1d8, I believe. Is that a bonus action or an action? It's a bonus action. I burn a spell slot, though. 1d8.
Bapef: So heal for seven. And then I'm gonna attack. I'm angry. My attack is d20 plus four. Add advantage because of packed attacks. Absolutely. So...
Albert: We got a 19 and an 8, so yeah. 19 hits. White weapon attack, melee weapon attack.
Albert: what does a wolf do because you use their stat block it's so it's melee weapon attack plus your regular plus so right uh so maybe a weapon attack plus four plus four yeah and it's bite so 2d4 plus two
Bapef: 2d4 plus 2. So, 7. 7, okay. So, as you dive at this animated armor, you topple it over, and it becomes lifeless and cold armor. So, you kill Sid. I sit there, and I stare in its face, and I'm like...
Bapef: All right. El Zeros, it is your turn. It's stabby stab time. That one. Ooh, yeah. So as you... All right. So as you swing and take a miss, it sidesteps you and you stumble over and fall prone since that natural one.
DM: Fair. Well, I will use my move to stand up. Alright, cool. Baslow. I would like to cast Vicious Mockery on B. I put my hands in the air and begin to scream at this large construct B, hoping that my friends won't be hurt by it any longer.
Bapef: Um, what does he have to succeed? Wisdom, what? Oh, Wisdom. So, um... Must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage. 13 for you. So yeah, he fails that. Oh, I see a 13. It's not for him, it's for the actual animated armor and he fails. So he takes that 4 damage for vicious mockery. 4 damage at disadvantage on next attack. Yep, and what do you call this thing?
DM: What, B? Yeah, because you cast Vicious Mockery. I call it just a big hunk of crappy metal, and to leave my friends alone. Bonus action... I can't get in there, the boys are there, so go ahead and turn. Muju, it is your turn. Alright, uh...
Theron: I turn towards the last remaining construct and I once again raise my focus and cast Thunderclap. It's a 13 constitution. Ooh, natural 1 on his part.
Bapef: Alright, so I've rolled my damage here, and I only did one damage. This time, it wells up in his chest and just lets it out of the cloud. Alright, and it is Animated Armor B's turn now. And he's going to go ahead and actually slam at you, Muju. And let's see here, five...
Theron: and you take uh yep you take uh seven damage uh can i use my reaction and he's burn a spell slot and cast shield if you would like to you can yeah that was a disadvantage right mike i will do that then yes i burn a spell slot and cast shield and take no damage
Bazlo: Is there a save on that for shield? Is there? No, you're just pushing your AC to a number higher than what you have. Right, right. Yeah. So I get five bonus AC from 15 to 20. Heck yeah. Cool. Is that your turn? Yes, that's my reaction, yeah. All right, Albert, it is your go. Oh, my oh me.
Bazlo: Let me ask you this. If I use Portent, that's just what it is, right? It doesn't matter if I'm at disadvantage or not? Yeah, correct. That's just what it is. Actually, that's a good point. Um...
Bazlo: Just as being a rules lawyer. I think Orton just tells you what happens. Because it's supposed to be divination, telling the future. Yeah, so what you do is you would roll disadvantage, you would take your dice that was lower and give it that. No, Orton is chosen before you roll the dice. Which is why this, why it matters. Why it matters, yeah. Got it.
Bazlo: I think Horton just determines the fate of the roll. It doesn't matter whether it's advantage or disadvantage. I think it's just like, this is what happens. Got it. It replaces the entire roll, not just one roll. So yeah. That's fucking sick. Um, I'm not going to use Horton, but I'm going to roll. I'm going to, I can't go through the enemy.
Bazlo: I am going to... Bonus action disengage. And I can't move my character for some reason. Bonus action disengage. Where are you trying to move? There you go. I'm just going to move over here. Okay. And that is going to be... Or action disengage. That's going to be my turn.
Bazlo: Okay, Theron is your go. I'm going to look at this guy. I'm going to yell, Stonest! The constitution said. And he does not meet it. A huge flash of light comes down from above and does four radiant damage. Four radiant damage, okay.
Albert: That's my turn. Alright. I'm going to attack with advantage. 17 hits. I'm going to see if I crit. Nope.
Bapef: 2d4 plus 8 or not 8 plus 2 yeah it's 2d4 plus 2 that's 9er 9 and then he has succeed a dc 11 strength flow or he's knocked prone okay cool so you hit this thing and knock it prone at the same time um and he takes 7 damage
Bapef: I just look at it. Azarius, is your turn? All right, time for Stabby Stabber, I'm three. At advantage, since it is Barone. All right, well, 15. No. 15.
Bapef: You take a stab at this and your short sword just glances off the armor. Paslow. Is there a spot where I can stand on the stairs to the right side of it over there? I mean, yes, but you would be... You'd be on a ledge. I could... Okay. Um...
DM: You can stand on the same tile as me. You can definitely try. Yeah. Yeah, you can stand on the same tile. Oh, there's only one person there. Okay, yeah. I'll just walk where Miru's at and go ahead and take a stabby stab as well at this guy. So, right here. 15. Does not hit. Okay, I will go ahead and try my offhand dagger. Oh.
Bapef: That definitely does not hit. As you take a swing at this animated armor, it just stands tall as your weapons glance off of it. Muju, it is your turn.
Bazlo: Alright. I am once again gonna raise my focus and cast Thunderclap. Alright. Let's see here. Con saving throw? Yes, 13. And he does not succeed it.
Bazlo: And I rolled a six. Perfect. So as you conjure up this thunderclap, it once again comes up underneath of its blast plate, and the armor just falls into a pile on the ground. And that is our combat. Huzzah. Yay.
Bapef: Yay. Wow, the music changed perfectly. That was good. Peaceful music flows in.
Bazlo: Alright, so as you guys look around at this once-animate armor strewn across the ground, you look around at this marble staircase and you also see the path to the attic ahead of you. What do you guys want to do? Baypef, feeling very proud of his companions, is going to immediately march up the stairs. Hold on, boy. Wouldn't you like to...
Bapef: Hold on, boy. Come here. Come here, boy. Come on. Heal. Heal. Can we maybe perhaps take a short breather? You guys can absolutely have a short rest. I did it again. Caboose. Myself. By the way, this is canon. When I'm a wolf, my name is Caboose.
Albert: Ben is secretly a furry, confirmed. Yeah. No, that's the name of his actual dog. Yeah. I'm just sitting here going... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's just ability checks. It's not attacks and saving throws. Yeah, it's just ability checks. But does a short rest... No. Okay. Okay.
Albert: All right, so short rest. Absolutely. I'm very down for a short rest. I get 1d4 plus 2. DM, can you choose not to take a short rest? You can choose not to expend your hit dice, but the party takes a short rest as a party. Cool. DM.
Bazlo: Yes. I'm using my Arcane Recovery to get a first level back. Alright, cool. What else do we get off of a short rest? I don't think we did it in the last campaign. So, depending at, like, bards at a certain level, you will get your Inspirations back, but I don't even know if you have those yet. But some classes get spell slots back and other things.
DM: You're at full health, but you can roll hit die too to get health back. Oh, so just roll kind of die just to... Are you at full health? He's already at full health. But to answer your question, Blake, up top, by your name, if you look to the right, it says short rest, long rest. You click on like that, and then you look...
DM: at your head down kind of like I only have two, you should probably have somewhere around two. So you can choose to use one or both of them, but that's all you get for your short rests. And that just adds a marker. And then you physically have to roll the dice. Yeah. So some classes have D6, D4, D8, D10. Sevens for your heal dice. Cool. Well, yeah.
Bazlo: hmm give me one second i've taken one short rest and that's marked off all right and actually i need you guys to go ahead and i remember i told you to look at what you want for level three i need you all to level up to level three okay um do not gain any hp back unless you got it from that do not regain your spell slots you just need to go up to level three but we will gain max hp right
Bazlo: Yes, you will gain max HP, but if you're missing HP, you don't... But if I'm at full, I will go to new full. No. Oh, yes. If you are at full, you will go to new full. Oh, hell yeah. Are we doing max for third level, or was that just the first two levels? No, go ahead and do max. Okay. After third level, you guys don't get any more max, just as a heads up. You need to roll for it or take the app. Yeah.
DM: So, spell time! Yeah. There's so many I want, but I can't. I'm prepared. Yeah, I can't.
Bazlo: boom good to go i can't remember what freaking bardic college i was supposed to go to i had it written for that project oh there it is i gotta get rid of these
Bazlo: By the way, Mike, just want to give you a pat on the back. You're doing so good. I love you. Thank you. Painting the scene for the mansion has been pretty damn good. Good, good, good. There are levels when I get to do second level spells, right? Okay. Okay, I had something here. I'll get my river to die.
DM: definitely picking up misty stuff what else do you think yeah i'm gonna get that as a feat later um um this is where i start to get better healing spells too
Albert: I could do whole person. I could do not, since we don't have a rogue. That might be good. Yeah, actually, that'll be really good. And then I get two more next levels. I'm sure Mike will give me a spell book at some point to where I can get some more stuff. I'm going to pick up a knock and rest in stone.
Theron: Also, as you guys are taking this rest, what are you guys doing? Oh, I remember that I have a note with a seal on it, and I pull it out of my pocket and start to examine it. What's the deal with spell slots on short rests?
Bazlo: Unless you're a warlock, you don't gain them back. Cool. Yeah. Baypef transforms before you guys back into his regular self. All right. Danny, while you are reading the note, I'm going to DM this to you. Okay. Yeah.
Theron: How do I complete leveling up? Do I just click out of the page? Yeah, if you've grabbed all your stuff, you just go back to your sheet. The confirmation button on this website is you click something and then click off of it. Okay, good to know. Yeah, it's getting there, alright? It's a huge volume of information, so it's a lot to take in. It is, yeah. It is, it really is. Yeah.
Bapef: Alright, let me check my character sheet. Okay, yeah, max health is up. Okay, cool. Let me check the DM. As Baypef transforms back into his regular self, he was like, uh, um, did my communication skills come across? I know I'm lacking. Did you guys understand what I was saying? You were a very good boy. It's the first time I've done that, but, uh, the
Muu: the future if we ever struggled to commune it looks down his hand communicate uh just you know do your best still learning our um how are we all doing on health are we all good to keep going i'm okay for now you know i'm gonna take that as a yes yes i am fine
Bazlo: During our short rest here, I casually break open the seal on the note and unravel the parchment and start to read. My eyes flitter back and forth and I start to read aloud to the rest of the party. My most pathetic servant, I am not a messiah sent to you by the dark powers of this land.
Bazlo: I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth. You say that you are cursed to your fortune spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son.
Bazlo: Pursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are. Your dreadlord and master, Strahd von Zarovich. And as Danny, or as Muju finishes reading that note off, you hear a baby cry down in the room below you.
Theron: And it continues to cry. Does that note say stillborn son? Or stillborn baby? I nod to Theron. That's exactly what it said. I have a theory. I believe there is some evil magic in this house that is driving the owners mad.
Elzerios: Sounds of babies, music, and the such. It would explain what's been going on. I concur. I believe we have two choices in front of us, gentlemen. My vote is to go to save the cries of the children, a child.
Elzerios: But we have heard that the disturbance that troubles us is from the attic. What do you guys think?
Theron: well let me let me uh we heard a creek downstairs did we not we went to investigate it and there was nothing we heard music on the second floor we went to investigate it and there was nothing we heard the bell
Theron: Right? And again, nothing. And Baypeth looks down to his hand again. No musician. Yes, I believe we must continue to the attic to find... Lazarus, what are you doing? Sorry, I'm trying to figure out something with my character level up. It's not applying to my dice. What are you trying to apply? The dueling bonus.
UnknownSP7: That's a refresh and restart thing that's been happening a lot. Like when I tried to create my character until I joined the campaign, I couldn't pick but one path. Yeah, it wasn't adding the damage, it fixed it now. Actually, side question though, Mike, you said we get max health for the first two levels, right?
UnknownSP8: First three levels, so yes, first two levels, yeah. How do we tweak the game to do that? So you're going to have to just manually interlayer it yourself in that case, so override your max HP, and it should tell you a maximum minimum when you go to change your HP. Yep, character levels, manage HP, and then just put your rolled HP to 3x what your dice roll is. Yep. All right, thank you.
Theron: And, uh, go ahead. Sorry about that, Geo. Okay, I was like, what? Is he, like, going ham over there? Just hitting somebody? Anyway, there was a bell and nothing. I believe the sounds of a child will be nothing as well. I agree. Shall we continue? In the attic? Absolutely.
UnknownSP8: Alright, I'll go ahead and go first. Up the attic I go. So, we'll follow in tow. You guys know the baby's not the same place as the attic, right? We're gonna get argument. Baby downstairs. Do you guys see where I opened up the... Oh. I see. The little L hallway? Yep, yep, exactly.
UnknownSP8: I am on Basil's token, so I'm not there with him. If you guys are moving over there to the L shape, go over to the L shape. Albert, we're going back down to two for now, so keep your thing over there. Or two per token.
UnknownSP8: All right, cool. So as you guys continue to walk up, it's just a barren hall chucked with dust and cobwebs. Let's see here. Are you guys going to open the door up here? Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Hello. Hello, Poppet. Hello, Poppet. Deez and Crumps.
UnknownSP8: Uh, I'm gonna go ahead and recast light on my focus again, since we probably expired after that short rest. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. As you cast light, of course, light fills the small hallway from which you guys are going up into this attic with. I step into the room.
UnknownSP8: So, the attic is choked with dust and cobwebs. A padlock door stands nearby, from which you hear the sounds of children playing. And he says, coming from a door. Yep. Padlock. Yep. That is the one directly in front of me. Can we get a little pointer?
UnknownSP8: How about you roll me a fucking perception check, Marius? Hell yeah, partner. Perceptive. As loud as the sounds of the children. Goddamn, not all three of you, but the sounds of the children playing come from the store right here. Our ears may deceive us. Indeed, as they have before.
Theron: That is not to say there's nothing in there, but it may not be what we think it is. It'd be Rosalda. I would like to take a look around the room. Is there anything else in the room? Quietly. Can I walk up to the door and say, knock? Rosalda, can you hear me?
Theron: There's no answers. You just continue to hear the children playing, and you just move right past it, Tork. Oh, that was ten minutes. That door. Yes. Which door is it? Sorry. This one. Fucking God. Put the dot on it. Is this thing on? There is a dot. There literally is a black dot. The black spot. That's why I moved up to that one. I thought we said no to that.
Albert: What happened? We can either sit here for ten minutes and I can try to see where magic's coming from, or we can start kicking in doors. Batriff walks in front of Atheros and transforms back into a wolf.
Bapef: I am going to cast Mage Hand and take a step back. So Mage Hand, I would like to cast it on the door. I flick my flute around in the air with a slight whistle. And I would like Mage Hand to open the door and see what's inside. The door is padlocked.
UnknownSP8: I forgot about that. So Mage Hand goes and floats over to the door and it, like, Cousin I
Bapef: it looks back at you and goes and just like shrugs its little fingers at you does anyone know how to open this lock let's get our wizard in here to take a look maybe i can but uh i can only do this so many times right um we think that's perhaps we could find a key somewhere
Bazlo: Caboose looks at the group and is like, Caboose, just tear through the door. Albert, give me an insight check. Insight. Knowing floods your mind and then slowly flickers out.
Theron: So you learn nothing. I want to maybe... Where's my token? It's me. Oh, I guess that works. Spin this door right here. I guess I could use you. Which door? That southern door. The one I'm next to now? Give me one second. Do you want to open this? Yes, I do.
Bazlo: So as you open the door, light slowly floods in. The door squeals open onto a spare bedroom choked with dust. The wardrobe lies open and empty. The desk is stained red with red wine.
Bazlo: Perhaps a rocking chair rocks slightly with the draft you've created while a doll in a lacy yellow dress smiles at you. Webs drapes her head like a wedding veil. Go to the desk and search it. Is there any drawers? Go ahead. Investigation check.
Bazlo: You rifle through this drawer and there's really nothing in it. A couple pieces of parchment and what seem to be crayons. Boy, Baypef, there's some crayons in here if you'd like some. Yeah, right. There's what in there? Crayons. Baypef eagerly runs over.
Albert: As they're doing this, can I do detect magic as a ritual? Yeah, absolutely. I'd like to do that. I'm gonna walk to this door to the south and gently open it. Baypef carefully picks out the most red types of crayons and sorts them before he eats them.
Bazlo: All right The chamber is packed with old furniture draped in yellowing sheets chairs coat racks Coaches dappled with mold standing mirrors and mannequins that loom out from the shadows like forgotten window or widows and witness to ruin a wooden trunk sits nearby its cover slightly ajar a
DM: Is there a door over here on the very end that I can see? It's a window. It's a window. Okay. I'm going to take the tarp off of one of these things. Yeah. Which one? We'll do this one right here. Yeah. As you pull the tarp off, it just seems like a chair.
Bazlo: Um, so, as you look around here, you do, again, notice an unlocked wooden trunk. Um, I'm gonna assume it's this steel thing right here, maybe? Yes. Okay, I wanna look inside.
Bazlo: Awesome. So as you look inside this trunk, you see a sheet bloodstained. It seems like there is a skeleton wrapped up inside of this. And with that, you hear a screeching wail and a whore runs down your back and spine. And I'm going to need you to roll for initiative. Everybody.
Bazlo: uh i mean if you guys would or yeah everybody needs to roll um hold on one second but uh specter here is gonna get uh first go yeah i wish i would have placed basil i mean i guess i'm holding on to his back right i'm over here munching crowns i would prefer to stay at the back of the room but
DM: I wanted to say that I was following the group exploring, providing light, but I just didn't want to interrupt. That's why I placed myself in the doorway. Alright. I need you all to rope Aslo and Theron. Heyo. Theron? You gotta tell him.
Bazlo: you got a 10 yeah you're the first i re-rolled but yeah that's fine you could use whatever all right so with the the specter surprising you in this case right um i i can't be surprised i don't think but i always well they're still going first to hit you okay oh no i'm the dm
Bazlo: What happened? What did you do? You take 13 necrotic damage. Oh, God. Yep. And go, big dog. Wait, so what does the specter do? So the specter is going to use life drain, a melee attack with plus four to hit, reach to five, one creature.
Bazlo: takes 3d6 necrotic damage. The target must all six succeed a DC 10 constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. Whoa. What was it? Constitution? Yes. DC 10. God damn it. He rolls a 15.
Bapef: Yes, yes, yes! This is what your character is all about. Orton is supposed to be used before the roll. I heard it, you rolled too fast, so you have the two, unless Mike wants to let you have the 15. In this case, because it would literally kill Geo's character, um... I'm pretty sure, let's read this again, 10 constitution saving throw, or it's... It wouldn't kill him, it would knock. No, that's...
Bazlo: equal to the damage taken yes his hit point maximum would be reduced by 39 points so he would that's big bad yeah he would be dead big bad oh he took 39 i thought you said 13 no 13 he would take 39 because he failed that constitution saving throw okay so on you
Bazlo: Yeah, no. We're not going to TPK Geo. I'm going to let this all be a warning to you, though. Knock him. Just knock him. Yes, we're going to knock him, but I'm going to let this be a warning to you. I'm not joking when I say this campaign is fucking deadly, so... When, and because of my ability, give yourself a second before you roll so I can have the chance to intervene.
Bapef: But I'm gonna cross that off my board. I got a nat 20 sitting on deck for, uh, port. Okay. I didn't know you could use that for, like, other people's dice rolls. Yes. That is part of divination that makes it awesome. And why he's gonna be crucial to keep it from DKPing. Geo, with that, you are knocked. What's DKPing? Uh, everybody dies. Oh, shit. Or TKP. I'm sorry.
Bapef: TPK. Total party kill. TPK. Got it wrong again. Total party kill. Albert, it is your turn. I'm assuming I hear the commotion going on in the room. Yes, absolutely. And I can share a spot with Murujin? Yes, you can. I would like to hop over here. 1, 2, 3. Cast a magic missile level 1.
Bapef: Okay. So there's one, two, three, and those are all plus one. Oh, it does it automatically. So that's 11 damage to the specter. And then for the rest of my turn, I'm going to move one, two, three away from it, and that is my turn.
DM: Muju, it is your turn. Alright. I am going to cast Chaos Bolt at the spectre. Alright. So here's my roll. So it was plus two with Theron. I guess he's crumpled on the floor, so it doesn't matter. Yeah, go ahead.
Theron: Okay, so the damage here? Yep. What do you say as you disperse this, or what happens to the specter as you disperse it? I need to see the roll, what kind of damage it is. It's 11. 11, okay.
DM: You've killed the Spectre. Okay, so as I raise my focus, already shimmering with light, a myriad of colors swirl, creating a large orb about the size of a tennis ball. It starts to crackle and spark, and it finally solidifies into a putrid green and flies from my focus and collides with the Spectre in its solar plexus.
Theron: The specter lets out a long wail as it falls and dissipates into the ground into white, wispy smoke. And that ends combat. I would like to go to our buddy and try to stabilize him, unless maybe Baypef wants to do that first?
Bazlo: I'm in a very different area. Oh, you're in a wolf. You're a wolf, too. But we're out of time. Yeah. Do I hear? Do I hear? You hear all of this. You hear the wailing. I immediately come scampering out. And I meet my companions.
Bazlo: And I put my two front paws down on the ground, and I'm like... Downward dog. Yeah, downward dog. Respective, uh, what-the-fuck-is-going-on pose. I need someone to give me a medicine check to stabilize their arm here. Um... Lads, I don't have the best medicine
Theron: Uh, skills, is anyone here? Or heal him. Ten seconds before I need you to roll a saving throw, Geo. Alright, I will try to... Give me a saving throw, Geo. That's been ten seconds. I'm doing it. I failed the first one. Take my flute. Alright, you have been stabilized.
Theron: Okay. That's just stabilized. That's not up. No, you're not up. You are stabilized, though. I've never heard that. That just means they stopped rolling. Yes. Yeah, they're no longer dying.
Bazlo: And then picking up is just action, right? I mean, it's not Baldur's Gate 3, you need to heal him. Yeah. Baypeth looks at you in a very curious way and puts one paw on his nose. And then puts it back down on his feet.
Theron: No healing? Okay. Is someone gonna fucking heal them? With that, boys, I will go ahead and, uh, Healing Ward... Healing Word on, um... Oh, gosh. What's your name? Theron. Roll. Nine. Sick.
Theron: Okay, so what was the deal with necrotic damage again? So you took 13 necrotic damage. That means until either someone uses a lesser restoration spell or you get a long rest, you can't regain those 13 necrotic hit points no matter how much you deal. Your max is essentially dropped. But let me ask you this. If he died, does he still hold that necrotic until long rest? He didn't die, though.
Albert: He still took the damage. I get up. Barely. But I can tell that I'm not fully... I didn't get the full healing that I should have and cast Lesser Restoration on myself. And Lesser Restoration will, I believe, take away the product damage. Yeah, and it doesn't heal me, but it makes it so I don't have...
Bapef: The new product, yeah. And then... Hold on, let's see here. Uh, could I gather my party out here in the hallway for a second? You can do whatever you want. Uh, fellows, fellows.
Bapef: This may sound odd. Hello, Maypeth. But if you see a creature in one of our battles, just start laughing. Uncontrollably, do not attack that creature. I have a spell which could possibly take someone out of combat, but if they're hit...
Bazlo: they're likely to get pulled out of the traps. Mapef chirps up and says, woof, woof. Good boy, Mapef. Technically, I can't understand what you're saying, so can you use hand and arm signals? There was a head rub. There's always a head rub with a good boy, Mapef. Just let that be known. Well, in your explanation, I can't hear what you're saying.
Theron: Oh, and also, uh, just straight necrotic damage doesn't actually lower your minimum, um, as a heads up. So, yeah, we're good. So he's good, doesn't he? So take your Lesser Restoration back, and heal the nine points, so you're at nine HP. It's only certain spells that do that. Okay, so I'm not, um... Thank you for clarifying that. I too have giggle power, Albert. Uh, powers of the giggle.
Bapef: And I'm actually going to spell, use my healing. Powers of the Giggle. I... Someone... In my spellbook, it's written as Tasha's Hideous Laughter. Do you have a spellbook, Bard? I mostly just etch them on the side of my flute. And you, Sorcerer, who hasn't studied a day in his life...
Bapef: I need not worry about the words of men. I study the weave itself. I was waiting for this. You know what? I actually respect that answer, but still, fuck you. Wizard fight. Caboose just goes, don't you say he's a wizard. He's just a fucking sorcerer. Yeah, they're all the same to me.
Bazlo: I'm visibly agitated. I'm visibly agitated. Walks into the other room. Oh, I guess I... Go ahead, sorry. You're good. Starts bounding off of the different rocks in the room to get to the other end and just points.
Bazlo: What are you pointing at? The door. That's a window. That's a window. Bounce back across. Playing on the rocks. Just being a happy puppy. And returns and wags his tail. Is there anything you guys want to do before I have Baypef tear down this door? I was looking for a D, but I don't know if that's such a good idea anymore.
Bapef: Sometimes you shouldn't poke your nose in places where it shouldn't be poked. It's an old proverb from Westeros. I would like to give someone a little pump-up song, possibly before we go into this door here.
Theron: Baypef goes on his hind legs and starts pawing at the door. Not to push, but to paw. I want to hear this song. Real quick, again, I'm going to let you all know that, hey, the door has a fucking padlock on it. But it's a wooden door, right? It is like solid oak. So fire would remove the door.
Bapef: um yeah probably scorch the door it would might take a minute yeah yeah all right first i want to hear this song from here i may hold off on the song um pending the door is actually
Elzerios: going to open. Baypeth immediately starts clawing and biting at this door. Nothing happens to the door. I am worse. But he is excited. A level 2 spell and I use knock. And a loud KOOM emanates throughout the fucking house.
Bazlo: As you see the padlock, just click open magically. Do you have that, Bard? Sorcerer? Don't worry about locked doors. Wait, so it did open? So, from behind the door, you hear the shouts of rock, paper, scissors, shoot! What do you guys want to do?
Theron: Somebody that's not me start walking through the door. Caboose is going to continue to pitter-patter at the door. I will bring my flute to my lips and play my song as I look at Baypef, the Bardic Inspiration song lasting 10 minutes. I don't have a song to sing.
Elzerios: You better play your instrument then. As you start to play your instrument, my pitter-patters start to become rhythmically aligned with what you're doing. And you now have a 1d6 added to attacks, ability checks, etc. Are you opening the door?
Bazlo: Alright, poke. Holy fuck, are you guys opening the door or not? Yes. Open the door. I assume I'm paired back with Zero? Yes, yes you are. Okay. Or, uh, I guess Zero's paired with you in this case. Okay. There's too many people standing at the door, can't get there. Alright.
Bazlo: So this room contains a bricked up window flanked by two dusty wooden framed beds sized for children. As soon as you creak the door open, the plane stops. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that is a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons.
Bazlo: wearing tattered but familiar clothing, smaller of the two cradles of stuffed doll that you also recognize. I want to walk in and give the skeletons a sniff, and I didn't know this before, but I get an advantage. Sniffing. On the sniffing hearing. What would you like me to roll? You're just going to be sniffing, that's it? Mm-hmm.
Bazlo: me a perception check investigation so as you sniff around you you recognize these skeletons have been dead for quite some time I lean back to my compatriots and I'm like
Theron: I'm coming, boy. I enter the room. Um... And these two things on either side of the door remind me again... The dollhouse and a chest. I would like to investigate the chest, not open it. I want to see if there's any magic or anything about this chest or anything unsettling about it.
Theron: It's a chest. It's chest. I am going to stand all the way out here. I'm going to cast Mage Hand and whistle to my dog to come out of there. And Mage Hand is going to go ahead and open that chest from a nice safe distance.
Bazlo: Uh, as soon as you open up the chest, um, two small ghosts appear over the sides of the beds. Um, they, you instantly, actually, no one recognizes them besides the wolf that's standing in the middle of the room. Um, but yeah. So, I guess the wolf sees that, uh, two small apparitions appear, and they look very familiar to you, Bayfaf. Can I do one half-action before we roll initiative?
Elzerios: There's no initiative. Oh, okay. I recognize them, but how do I recognize them? Do I know who they are? Give me a history check. Is it the children?
Bazlo: Nat 20. Cool. You see that these are the children that you spoke with outside. Their apparitions hang above the beds and they shout, don't touch our toys! Stay away from the chest! Even though whoever did it is standing outside in the hallway. Hmm. Interesting choice. Because I can't speak English right now. I'm coming in.
Elzerios: Bay path is going to the first thing he's going to do is knees high on his hind legs, feet forward all the way forward. Like a big stretch is going to bow his head. You hear the cat or the, the kids go puppy.
Bazlo: Would you kids like to pet the puppy dog? They look at you with some, I guess, disdain as you're the one who messed with their toys. Children, I have a question for you. Who did this to you? What do you mean, who did this to us? There's a monster in the basement. Last we saw you, you were outside.
Bazlo: Perfectly fine. Maybe a little sugar though. What happened since then? Who hurt you? Wait, wait, wait. Don't move in yet. Hold on. No, if he moved in, it's fine. He can move in. Yeah, he can. This is a roleplay part. Just fucking relax. Hold on, you said your parents were in the basement? Yeah, they were in the basement. When we were outside, your parents told us you were in the fucking attic.
Albert: And here we find you. What the fuck kind of game is this? I rolled a 17 and you told me you were telling the truth. You were telling the truth.
Bazlo: Why are you being meta? There's a point to it. Stop it. This is absolutely not meta. This is Albert recognizing that they told us to go to the fucking attic, and now we're at the attic. You said 17! So Baypef is going to walk up to one of the ghosts, and his head is down.
Elzerios: right so his eyes obviously for dogs can see very well when they're down in a very respective manner bay path is going to walk to the left ghost and try to lick their hand you try to lick their hand and your tongue goes through uh ethereal mist bay path is going to sit and listen
DM: Children, do you remember us by any chance? No, this is the first time we've seen you. I see. Have you seen anyone, any other strange adventurers coming through here, or just anyone that shouldn't have been here before? Plenty have come, but none have left.
DM: I see. And how many have gone down to the basement? Countless. Untold. Do they ever come back from the basement? No. The hair on Baypef's back starts to stand. And with that, they both disappear.
Elzerios: Baypuff walks over to Vaslo and paws his hand or leg, whatever he can reach, and starts just gently pushing his hand into the ground. As a down boy, you would like us to go to the base?
Elzerios: One bark for yes, two for no. Theron, what do you think? Shall we head to the basement? You know, I think there's only one path forward. I am curious to see what else we can find up here. Give me a perception check. Anybody. Here. Not me, actually. Just kidding.
Theron: Nat 20 Theron and babe not babe your goddamn wolf Theron as you look to your left you see a dollhouse and you see that it is an exact replica of this house I want to examine the basement area of this dollhouse
Theron: Just give me a... Give me an investigation check. Can I give myself guidance? Give me an investigation check.
Theron: All right. So as you start to look over this house, you see each one of the rooms that you've been to and a few that you haven't opened. But you also see that there seems to be a secret staircase from the room where the specter was that leads down. Gentlemen, do you see this staircase that is in this house, this dollhouse right here? I see it. I believe we might...
Bazlo: If we go back to that room we were in, we might find the way down. Baypeth looks at this, takes a little... And trounces over into the room. As you all leave the room, you hear a, Wait, don't go! Um, Albert and...
Theron: Theron, I want you guys to give me a wisdom saving throw. Wait. I'm at disadvantage. God damn it. One more. Okay.
Theron: Um, you guys, I'm going to both DM you on the side. Um, just add these into your character essentially. Okay. And don't tell, you know what I'm saying? Like you just act accordingly. Um, and actually, can you, I have you guys drop down into a channel real quick. Okay. I have questions. Yep.
Theron: Well, it's everyone down there. Give me one second, guys. I need them to create. Wait, Mike, I don't have disadvantage on saving throws. Hold up. Hold up. He's going to grab you. Oh, OK.
Bapef: They're cursed, right? Yeah. Yeah. Judging by the name of the campaign. We're going to have to worry about our buddies here. So, but play true to your characters and what their goals are. Okay. I'm going to be sniffing and digging the whole time because I'm a little doggy. I'm going to be fluting and tooting.
Bapef: yeah and he's gonna give me the opportunity to sniff stuff out but i can't do that anymore so keep that in mind okay so kind of still try to do like perception checks or whatever we can to investigate rooms okay yeah plus three on perception so
Theron: And they're all- look, they're in the- yep, nevermind. They're coming back! What are you guys, talking shit up here? Nothing! Mike's the worst! Yeah, I'm the worst, I know. Alright. I have to ask this guy what he can do with the noobs.
Albert: All right. They're on. Okay. So I'm going to follow the... Oh, there it is. Following the wolf down the staircase. Who's partnered with me?
Theron: Yeah, we should go back to a single. Elzerios has partnered with me. Which token do you guys want to use for that? Elzerios. Okay, cool. And I'm still a daypiff. Have we found this yet? We haven't found a way. Yes, you know it's absolutely there because we put two and two together.
Theron: All right. Give me one second here. All right. So as you guys walk into this room where nothing once stood, a black door now leads down into only darkness.
Theron: A tight staircase spirals down into darkness between the walls of mortared stone. Cobwebs and dust are everywhere. The citizens of this cramped passage, down and down into the depths you go, shaft growing tighter and tighter. The air is stale, even bitter. Just as you can handle it no longer, just as your lungs are fit to burst, you find yourself before an archway that leads into a tunnel of carved earth and cold stone.
Theron: You guys look up on the top right. It is pitch black down here. So, you know, as you guys come into here, if you have night vision or dark vision, you can see deep. If you don't, you are going to need light. Okay. How long has it been since our short rest? Is your spell 10 minutes? No, light's an hour.
Bapef: We'll say it's been 30. Okay. Also, I refreshed. I can't see top right. Imagination time. Use your imagination. Yeah, it's showing for me. It's to the right of the main manor in front of you. Yep.
Theron: I wish that was true. Okay. So, um, the tunnel forks left and then right, leading both into darkness, and then, floating out from the ground, the utter blackness from the nighted depths, chanting ethereal chanting by a score of souls, chanting that echoes off of every stone and corner of this wretched place, rising and falling in innotation,
Theron: The words, too distant, too faint to discern, but eerie and incessant. The chanting caresses you like an old lover, too far gone to be touched, but too close to be forgotten. Rook is leaving the way.
Elzerios: Who's going first, gentlemen? I vote you or not me. Whichever one goes first. Alright. I roll my sleeves up. Get my food out in case...
DM: I was muted, sorry. I said that I would lead since I have the light, and I asked, is this still the two person per tile rule? Yeah, we're still doing two person per tile because it's all fucking small up in here, boys. Okay, well if Basil wants to go first, I'll just tag along with him, and I can switch out with Theron, who's now in APEF. Mm-hmm.
Theron: you grab a little but on this one on now I see it look at it go you're next to me we're gonna fear there's a mine some other so we don't have to worry about moving tokens everywhere heads-up this group uses 0 there on
Albert: I accidentally dragged mine to the fog, so it's somewhere. Narnia. Fuckin' of course it is.
Bapef: Would you like to lead the way, or would you like me to? You can go ahead and lead. I'm just providing you light. Here we go. Alright, which way do you guys want to go? I start by going south. Alright. I'm slowly creeping along, quietly. So, as you continue to go south, you come to a fork in the path.
Albert: The cold, dank tunnels are still just closing in forever, made of dirt and mortar. I look back at the party, just give them a nod and a hand signal. And continue to the apex here. Peek around the corners.
Albert: And continue on because I see something dim light. Investigate whatever this wood structure appears to be. All right. Is everybody just following Baslow in this case? Mm-hmm. Yep.
Bapef: Long benches flank a scratched wooden table. Bones litter the floor like ripped up chunks of carpet. You accidentally kick one, sending it sailing through the darkness. The chanting grows ever louder, ringing off of the edge until finally infesting your teeth like vagrants. You try to get it out of your head, but you can't, and you find yourself humming along instead.
Albert: Is it affecting me in any other way other than I'm just singing along? What do you boys think about turning around and maybe not going towards us because I can't stop singing. It's stuck in my head.
Bazlo: As far as you all can tell, it's coming from all around you. You can't pinpoint which way it's coming from at this point. God damn it. DM. As written. I'm still a wolf, so I'd like to sniff and hear with advantage. Forgot that I could do that. Go for it, Rick.
Bapef: Is our wolf humming as well? Is our what? Is our wolf humming as well? Yes, he's just... 24. Okay. Good beat. You still cannot tell where the chanting is coming from. It is just ringing off all of the walls. Your smell is also just clouded. All you smell is death, decay, and bones.
Bapef: what's the time passing here um this is like minute to minute we're not going super fast here or super slow here i would like to shoot silver down the hallways cool which hallway would you like to go down all of them uh i'll start at the top left maybe so can you show me on the map yes uh
Bapef: uh second one on the left hand side i would like to go down that passage right there to the left okay cool um give me a perception roll for silver and i'm not gonna unveil it but i will describe it to you if that works for you whatever works for you boss uh so that is actually 12.
Bapef: Well, and that's okay. So as Silver heads down these halls, they flap around and you can hear them, the sounds of their wings alongside the chanting rhythmically. What Silver sees is another wooden table flanked by four chairs and what seemed to be some alcoves or offshoots as well.
Bapef: Um, and just as this is going on, Silver's checking places out and then coming back to me. Okay, cool. Yeah. Um, I will also give you an idea of the room size. The main room size is three by three with, um, a descending, like, pillar that's two by two that goes down. Hmm.
Theron: I'm going to do something. Let's hear it. I'm going to use one of our ranger spell slots. I can detect whether there are any aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fae, fiends, or undead within one mile of us. Give me one second, please. Hell yeah, partner. Before you ping the map for everything. Okay, let me see if
Bapef: Faith, fiends, elementals, what else? Aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends are undead. Okay, perfect. Nice. All the spooky stuff. Are there any bad mans down here? So how is this spell written? Do I actually ping the areas? No, it does not reveal their location or direction.
Bapef: Yeah, you feel an unimaginable presence of undead everywhere around you. Uh, guys? There is either a very strong or unimaginable amount of undead near us. Theron, give me actually a religion check.
Bapef: I had disadvantage, hold on. Well, doesn't matter. Oh, that's a persuasion check, bud. Yeah, you noticed nothing. Alright. Anyone want to lead, or shall I continue?
Albert: Well, Silver says there's a large 3x3 room at top left, but he didn't say anything other than that, so I don't believe there's much to be seen there. Okay. Let's go ahead and maybe stay closest to our exit. I'm going to take a step back, come down here and go all the way to the right. Do I see anything down by there?
Bapef: So as you go into this offshoot, you...let me see here... Crips have been hewn from the earth, some sealed by slabs, some left ajar. The dirt and grime is too thick to read the names engraved upon the slabs.
Bazlo: Seeing as our spell may have given us an idea of what's around us, I'm not going to touch these. Would you like me to clean them off at all? You want to clean them off? I'm asking our party if they would like me to clean off the headstones. Oh, I think you shouldn't touch them at all. Very well.
Albert: The ringing and chanting still continues to fill your mind. I will take a look over here, to the left. Just slowly peek around the corners. Oh my god. I do not feel good about this. Let me see your face when you talk to me, boy.
Albert: Where's our master of the undead and spiritual things? Theron, would you like to continue? Maybe play a little? Nothing good can come. There is nothing good that comes from this situation, but let's move forward. After you, good sir. I think, personally, we should probably leave. Baypeth lets out an inquisitive whoop.
DM: Yeah, we should probably go back out front door from where we came. Yeah, I concur. So we're going to try to leave? Are you talking about leaving the entire area? Not the entire area, just this immediate vicinity. Yes. My bed sounds like an excellent place to lay.
Albert: Bazlow skips. He likes to skip sometimes when he's moving quickly back down the hallway.
DM: As you guys pass the staircase, Baypef lets out another little... So, as you pass the staircase, you actually notice that the wall has been sealed back up. As if there was never a staircase there. Goddammit! You kind of see Albert visibly start to freak out a little bit again. Okay.
DM: Now you have nowhere to run, you have to fight. Zach, give me a charisma saving throw.
DM: No, it's a good thing for this one, motherfucker. Perfect. As you try to fight off whatever's inside of you, it leaves you. All together. All together. You're good. All together now. You're breaking up. What's the...
DM: Okay, okay. We're going to explore these rooms one by one. We're going to try to map our position as we go through. This seems to be a maze that's ever-changing.
DM: Perfect. And gentlemen, I think now is a great time to go ahead and stop because there's other encounters in here that will push us over by 13 minutes. So I think with the stairway blocking itself up and things like that, I think we call it here.
